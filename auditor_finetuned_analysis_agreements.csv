97-A-008,Active,Exclusive License,"On the scale of GE, those aren’t huge royalties.  My guess is that some very thorough person at GE did the math and figured out that we were owed this little amount and it was easiest for them just to cut the check then second-guess it.  Looking back at the agreements, if I’m recalling it right, I think one big change at the acquisition was that our royalty base no longer included getting paid on services using the software, but rather only on licensing the software to customers.  If that’s correct, and if a majority of GE’s business using this technology is offering services rather than distributing the software, then that’s what we’re getting paid on.  (And we agreed to this change because it was seen as a necessary trade-off to facilitate the SmartSignal acquisition, enabling us to liquidate our equity.)     Also our field of use does not include using the software for customers in energy production – GE gets rights to that field through Argonne, so that’s another reason our royalties are low.

14-A-102,Active,Non-Exclusive License,"Hi Teana,  Part of the distribution for Stressmarq goes to MIT (85%) however there is no IIA in the record nor do I think this is under an IIA.  I vaguely remember that Susan Lindquist wanted her share to got to her new lab, but there is also not a redirection of personal share in the file and that would have only been her 25%.       I don’t know how this would have fit in the policy or if Alan approved it(?) but at the minimum we need some back up in Inteum.  Secondly, the obvious, Susan has passed away and I have an accumulation of distribution earmarked for MIT (we continue to get small royalties every year).  The total is $2,677.77     1. I think we can either, send MIT the money, they may ask for back up and I guess we could say it was directed by Susan and they can do whatever they want 2. We can go to a default distribution and I can include it on Susan’s estate distribution 3. Or we can move it all to Pending VP Research 4. Other ideas?

Invoice 6328 is dated as 1/22/2019, so if they were paying both invoices at that time, the total amount would be within range ($4,187.87 - $4,262.65).

10-A-094,Active,Exclusive License,"Dear Teena and Luke,      Significant changes to the European patent system, i.e., a Unitary Patent system, will take effect in Europe on June 1, 2023.  The Unitary Patent system is inextricably linked to the creation of the Unified Patent Court, which will have jurisdiction over Unitary Patents and ""classic"" European patents.     Under the existing system, a patent granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) needs to be separately “validated” in each country of interest into separate, national patents. Accordingly, a patent needs to be enforced and/or challenged in each EPO-member country in which it is validated.  Under the new Unitary Patent system, a granted “unitary patent” will automatically be effective in all participating countries, and its validity will stand or fall globally.  Similarly, products that infringe in one country will infringe in all participating countries.  Several European countries (i.e., the United Kingdom, Poland, Spain, Croatia, Switzerland, Norway, and Turkey) will not participate in the new Unitary Patent system, and any European patent to be enforced in those countries will still need to be separately validated, enforced and/or challenged in those countries.       For some patent owners, the fact that a finding of invalidity (or non-infringement) will be effective across all participating countries could be a disadvantage.  For others, who may be interested in patent protection in only a few countries (typically three countries), maintenance fees under the new system will be more expensive.  Because of these possible disadvantages, an opt-out provision has been provided both for pending applications and existing patents.  For pending applications, there is no immediate deadline.  For existing patents, the deadline to opt-out of the unitary patent system is June 1, 2023.       Given that the opt-out period is non-extendable, and European patents can individually be opted into the Unitary Patent/UPC system (once) later, if desired, we recommend (provided you have the authority to do so) having us coordinate opting out of the Unitary Patent/UPC system with all your European patents and pending applications.  Thus, please confirm we may instruct our European agent(s) to opt out for all your European patents and pending applications by signing and returning the attached authorization form.  There may be a charge assessed by our European agent which may vary depending on the number of European patents to be opted out, which you agree to pay by signing this authorization.  It is understood that, so long as the ownership details are consistent across a portfolio of EPO patents, all such patents can be opted out together, in the event it is desired to opt-out all applicable EPO patents.       While it is possible to opt some or all your European Patent Organization (EPO) patents out of the new Unitary Patent system and the corresponding Unified Patent Court, we require your explicit instructions by the end of January 2023, if possible, if you wish for us to take action to request that your entity’s EPO patents are opted out during the revised March 1-May 31, 2023 “Sunrise Period”.   Our records indicate that there are  one or more European Patent Organization (EPO)-derived patents or pending EPO patent applications in the UC/Electrochaea portfolio that may be impacted by these changes.  We write because we need your instructions about whether you would like to officially “opt out” of the Unitary Patent system.  In addition, for European patents that have more than one owner, all owners must give consent to “opt out.”.     As there may be practical bottlenecks to opting out of the Unitary Patent system as the June 1, 2023 deadline approaches, it is recommended that we instruct the European agent(s) of the decision whether or not to opt out of the Unitary Patent system as soon as possible.  We would appreciate your instructions by the end of January 2023.     Please let us know if you want to opt out, and if have any questions.       Happy holidays,   Sharon            Sharon M.

Our existing partners MVP, Storengy, KfW, Caliza, Focus First, Energie 360°, and btov are also participating in the Series D financial round.      Growing our team. The foundation of Electrochaea’s success is our creative and dedicated team, and in 2021 we expanded our business development team with the appointments of Joe Feldman as Executive Vice President for North American Business Development and Peter Plesner as Director of Business Development in the growing Nordic markets. In 2022, we will further expand our team with experienced and dedicated professionals to bring Electrochaea to a new level of commercial development.      Tackling climate change regulatory policies. While much work and international cooperation remains ahead, country leaders and governments are increasingly focused on policies that can ensure a sustainable future. Electrochaea actively participated in regulatory proceedings in both North America and Europe, providing input regarding the important role of sustainable methane and power-to-gas in renewable energy storage and decarbonization.       Archetype plant design completed. The basic design and detailed engineering for a 10-MWe standardized biomethanation plant has been completed. The project work was aided by funding from the EIC Accelerator Program. With the completion of the design, Electrochaea is looking for the best project for deployment of the design with focus on a site in Roslev, Denmark.     Intellectual property expanded. In Germany, Electrochaea has been granted a patent for a method to type Electrochaea´s biocatalyst for quality control and rapid identification.  A utility model for our heat exchange system has been registered in Germany and the patents that we have exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago are now granted in the EU.     Biomethanation plant in Maine. In the U.S., Electrochaea`s biomethanation technology is included in a grant awarded from the U.S. Department of Energy to Summit Utilities, in collaboration with NREL, SoCalGas, Plug Power and Electrochaea. A pilot scale power-to-gas biomethanation plant will be operated utilizing a stream of biogas from an anaerobic digester processing dairy manure in Clinton, Maine. The resulting methane will be injected into Summit’s common carrier natural gas pipeline system. It is the first power-to-gas facility in the U.S. to be fully integrated into the energy supply, replacing fossil gas use.     Biomethanation plant verified. Electrochaea’s process was verified at our BioCat methanation plant in Avedøre, Denmark, as part of the European Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The independent certification of our technology is further confirmation that Electrochaea´s process performance claims are based on reliable data and that our biomethanation process is ready for commercial use at scale.

I’ve also reached out to Teana Stocco to see if she can point us to someone at Polsky that might be able to weigh in.  Both Engie and Baker Hughes are in the loop but we don’t know yet how they will engage, if at all.  But they understand the issues at hand.     Constructive change to the current rules could significantly (and positively) impact the market for our business in the US, and support investments to expand the supply of RIN qualified gases for the US market.  The rule change we are supporting would greatly improve project economics and supply options for RIN-qualified methane from WWTP, landfill, ethanol fermentation and other anaerobic digestion sources.   Basically, we are asking that the new rule should allow fuels from any biogenic CO2 source and any renewable energy feedstock (e.g. wind and solar) to qualify for the federal RIN program. Such products are not specifically allowed under the current rules, but are encompassed in the initial legislation.     The changes we suggest would provide significant financial incentives to produce fuels using the technology we licensed from the University and attract capital to invest in production facilities. Similar rule making has stimulated the corn ethanol and biogas upgrading industries but those rules do not include our process.     Importantly, the existing rules were constructed before your work  was known to the regulatory community and well before our commercialization efforts were realized.

It has been supplied to LabCorp   in 12.5x dilution which corresponds to many year’s worth as previously required.

Note that I routinely provide a small, separate  aliquot to be used for that purpose.     Last year we terminated our use for clinical activity but not an ongoing research-related testing which makes for a far smaller   consumption in our use.

I’d like to know what you think about the best process for being sure that we’re getting the payments we should be from our Perkin Elmer license.  In particular, it’s just come to my attention that we didn’t get a sublicensing payment from PE when they sublicensed last winter/spring.  Additionally, the attached might lead one to speculate that they are paying a fraction of their royalty as a sublicense flow-through rather than the straight percentage on sales by sublicensee as they should.

16-A-178,Active,Exclusive License,"Dear Teana,     As promised, I am back to you in relation to your request below on the milestone payment.     The study that obtained the approval to proceed from CBER on January 2020 and for which the enrolment started in Jun 2020 is a Phase 1 trial designed to have the very first part, called dose-escalation safety lead-in, fully focused on First Time in Humans assessment of the vaccine safety profile (32 subjects overall, divided in 4 groups of 8 subjects to be exposed sequentially to half dose unadjuvanted, full dose unadjuvanted, half dose adjuvanted, full dose adjuvanted).Due to COVID-19 pandemic impact, this initial part of the study is still ongoing and according to current plans we should be able to complete it within Q2 2021.     Only with this safety part completed successfully, we will be able to start the second part of the study, called Proof of Principle, designed to generate in the target population (subjects with SA-SSTI infections) evidence on the vaccine efficacy.     Hence, since we are not starting a Phase I/II as recited in section 3Hii of the agreement but only a Phase I for safety, we retain that the milestone will not be due until the safety lead in is completed. Only at that time, we will be able to start the actual Proof of Principle, which, although still officially a Phase I and not a Phase I/II, we agree can be considered a Phase I/II for the purpose of the License and suitable to trigger the payment, which will happen in the second half of the year.

16-A-178,Active,Exclusive License,"Hi Teana,     I read the below more carefully.  I didn’t find the trial on a quick search online – I expect in more time I’ll use the right combination of search terms if they started in the US.     They described a PhI/II trial design.  The Phase II part comes in when the first subject at risk (as opposed to healthy volunteer) is tested for efficacy markers (e.g. “efficacy and immunogenicity in the subjects at risk of staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections”).  According to the below, that would be the Second Epoch.  Usually such testing is done after the highest safe dose is established in healthy volunteers during the pure Phase I part.     So I guess the question is: do we interpret that since the trial design overall  is for PhI/II and they have commenced the trial, albeit the PhI part, money is due.  Or do we interpret that they have to start dosing for the second epoch and actually into the Phase II to be say they have achieved the milestone?     I assume the best for us to assert the first and ask for the money, but say we are willing to talk to them about it.  We can say, as you point out, the agreement is a bit unclear.

It looks to me that the preclinical studies are done; both original and derived constructs have been tested in vivo. The fact that they are going back to the original construct for protein engineering suggests that the original construct is their lead candidate. Of course, they might argue that further protein engineering could lead to newer constructs which require preclinical testing. If so, we cannot argue against it based on the language in the Development Plan.     This is my long way of saying – perhaps we can write to the company and ask for clarification? If they don’t agree with our interpretation (preclinical studies are completed and lead candidate is selected), at least we would get a better sense of what the milestone should be, from their perspective.

22-A-073,Active,Non-Exclusive License,"Xianyong,  The sequences are correct and not duplicates. When the selection was made, the selection pressure resulted in the library human WT light chain. The heavy chain is specific to the target antigen. These were validated for the targets specified. The conserved region is conserved, meaning it is the same and it originates from the library framework.  Each variable region has a framework around the CDRs that originates from the library.  The CDRs are the important sequences in each arm of the antibody with the heavy chain 3 as the most important. That light chain is paired with the heavy chains, as listed, and were results of the selections, as listed. It is correct.   Thanks.

22-A-073,Active,Non-Exclusive License,"Anna,  Just FYI.  Over the years I have done many analyses on the light chain but not going to share that information with Abcam. In over 40 selections, the wild-type light chain showed up 19% of the time. These were all good antibodies. If the selection results in wild type light chain, that is the result.  The sequence structure is conserved for human DNA.  The CDRs have to fit into the target protein to be anti-target. I don't know what else to say to him. Maybe the WT light chain is the best fit paired with the heavy chain to be anti-target. They don't need to know how we do our research, which is what I think he is fishing for.   Thanks.

22-A-073,Active,Non-Exclusive License,"Anna,  I am working on a reply to Abcam. There are no duplicate sequences. I am not sure what they are looking at.  Antibodies have 2 arms for the light chain and heavy chain. It is common for the light chain to have the same or similar sequence. It fits into the protein a certain way. The important arm is the heavy chain, which has a very specific affinity and binding to the target Antigen Protein.  The light chain and heavy have a non-coding region in-between, which puts the heavy chain out of the frame if sequenced straight through. Plus the DNA sequence length has its limitations in clear, quality results. Thus, in sequencing the DNA, the heavy chain and light chain are sequenced separately using different primers. The best I can do to prevent AbCam's confusion is to add in the non-coding link with an extra nucleotide. We do not have a link to a box to share sequences with them.   Thanks.

22-A-073,Active,Non-Exclusive License,"David,  The complete sequences submitted to you, which include the light and heavy chains, have no duplicates. Perhaps somebody only looked at the light chain portion. Antibodies have 2 arms for the light chain and heavy chain. It is common for the light chain to have the same or similar sequence. The CRD3 in the heavy chain is probably the most important region for affinity and binding to the specific target antigen.  There is a non-coding region in-between the light chain and heavy chain in the cloning plasmid vector. When sequencing the DNA, the heavy chain and light chain are sequenced separately. When the antibody protein is expressed, the signal and non-coding regions are not included.  A new column was added to the sequence request sheet with the complete light and heavy chain sequence concatenated together. I hope this resolves the issue.  Thank you.

19-A-0111,Active,Non-Exclusive License,"Thelma & Teana (and others):     There’s been a little confusion about how exactly the 45% of non-author CryptoClub revenue is to be distributed. It appears that incorrect numbers have crept into recent drafts of the agreement, possibly because of redlining and awkward line breaks.      One of the attached files, for example, has an incorrect distribution in which the 5% for Michael Ross shifts to UChicago STEM Education, giving it 13%,  rather than to the CryptoClub project. UChicago STEM Education’s share should remain constant at 8%, not increase to 13%, and CryptoClub’s should increase from 32% to 37%. Another incorrect distribution appears in the email below (from Teana to Janet), which shows the UChicago STEM Education share going down to 5% and the CryptoClub project’s share increasing to 40%.      Since at least 2019, we at UChicago STEM Education have agreed that “For the first three years 32% will go to the CryptoClub project, 8% to the Center, and 5% to Michael Ross. After the first three years, the share that had been directed to Michael Ross would go instead to the CryptoCub project.”      So, the distribution we want is as follows:     Revenue for the period 11/26/19 to 11/25/22 will be distributed as follows:  Janet Beissinger                20%  Bonnie Saunders              20%  The CryptoClub Project 32%  UChicago STEM Education 8%  Michael Ross                        5%  TOTAL                                   85%     Revenue accruing after 11/25/22 will be distributed as follows:  Janet Beissinger                20%  Bonnie Saunders              20%  The CryptoClub Project 37%  UChicago STEM Education 8%  TOTAL                                   85%        The second attached document has this correct distribution.

The UC-Kendall Hunt publishing agreement says royalties will be paid semi-annually, with amounts due the University on or before April 30 and October 31 of each year. When will royalties be distributed by the university to the authors, the project, and the Center?  We just started paying inventors quarterly for everyone who has a tax form on file, so depending on when the royalty is received.  It looks like the past payments were received in May and November, so if they stay with that schedule and based on our schedule, we would process those payments in September and February respectively. Since the inventor share agreement was just finalized the last distribution was missed, but will be in the next one which is November (however we will need to receive your tax forms prior to that). 2.

19-A-0121,Active,Exclusive License,"Oh this is such an agreement!     Ok, the Y1 definition now equals 12/17/2020 – 12/17/2021.   This is relevant because the % royalty owed during that time (and for Years 2-8) will be  1.5% Net Revenue from non-therapeutics and 2.5% net revenue from therapeutics, and there’s going to be a step down starting on Y9.        Then there’s the minimum royalty of $35K, starting in Y1, against which actual royalties are payable.     The payment section says, “The Company shall pay Net Revenue Sharing amounts owing to the University on a quarterly basis, with such amounts due and received by the University on or before the seventy-fifth (75th) day following the end of the Calendar Quarter in which such amounts were earned.     So if I’m reading this correctly, they owe us the Net Revenue that was generated by their First Commercial Sale by March 16th, 2021, which is 75 days after the end of December 31st.  And then all other Net Revenue payments are due 75 days after the end of the quarter of the sales, so 75 days after March 30th, June 30, September 30, December 31s, etc….       So, if that all follows, then we would not be able to determine if an additional payment to square up their minimum royalty obligations would be required until either they pay us the last quarter of Y1 on March 16th 2022 or they report that there are no royalties owed for Y1Q4, such report due 45 days after the end of the quarter (~February 15th 2022?) , so we would bill them for the remaining minimum royalty payment after that time.

Hopefully this is a fast review – I think these are the only remaining issues!   I plan to send you a summary for the special China license review later today.        Reservation of Rights (2D, page 4):   They’ve added to the very end of the section:       University reserves the worldwide right to: (a) practice or have practiced, and to grant to third parties the right to practice or have practiced, the Licensed Patents, including tangible property embodying the same, for Non-Commercial Research Purposes and for the conduct of its operations and the operations of its Affiliates and (b) permit its Affiliates (including the University of Chicago Medical Center (“UCMC”)), contractors, and consultants to do any of the activities set forth in (a) in connection with the operations of University and its Affiliates (including UCMC). For the avoidance of doubt, the rights retained by University include the right of University and its Affiliates and other third parties that are non-profit or governmental entities to practice the Licensed Patents for their respective healthcare operations and patient care purposes. For clarity, University shall not grant third parties the right or license under University’s retained rights to practice or have practiced the Licensed Patents for commercial purposes.      Can we agree to this addition?  As you probably recall – they are worried that we would do commercial licenses to other medical centers, for some reason.              University Indemnification (8D, page 19):   They’ve limited the Losses to third party claims:         University Indemnification. Company shall, and shall cause each other Licensed Entity to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless University, its Affiliates and the trustees, directors, officers, students, employees, fellows and agents of any of the foregoing (collectively the “University Indemnified Persons”) from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, costs and/or expense (including attorneys’ and witnesses’ fees and court costs) of any kind or nature (the “Losses”) that any University Indemnified Persons may be required to pay one or more third parties as a result of a third party claim based upon, arising out of, or otherwise relating to this Agreement and/or a Sublicense, including without limitation (i) any claim arising from the development, production, use, sale, export, import or other disposition of any Licensed Product and all activities associated therewith, or (ii) any use of information provided by University to any Licensed Entity; provided, however, that in no event will the Company be required to indemnify a University Indemnified Person any Losses to the extent resulting from a University Indemnified Person’s fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement. Subject to Company’s right to direct, defend, or settle any legal actions, University will be entitled to participate at its option and expense through counsel of its own selection, and may join in any legal actions related to any such claims, demands, losses, damages, costs, expenses and penalties. University will provide the Company, at the Company’s expense, with information and assistance reasonably necessary for the defense and settlement of such claim. No Licensed Entity will enter into any settlement affecting any rights or obligations of any University Indemnified Person or which includes an express or implied admission of liability, negligence or wrongdoing by any University Indemnified Person, without the prior written consent of University. In the event Company incurs costs that are attributable to Licensed Products infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, then, if it is required to comply with governmental regulations, such costs may be deducted from future Royalties owed to University. Company agrees, and will cause each other Licensed Entity to agree, not to sue any University Indemnified Person in connection with the development, production, use, sale or other disposition of Licensed Products and all activities associated therewith, except for (i) willful misconduct or gross negligence of such University Indemnified Person; or (ii) a breach of this Agreement by University.     Can we agree to this addition?       Assumption of Risk (8F, page 20):       A. Assumption of Risk. The entire risk as to the performance, safety and efficacy of any subject matter claimed in any Licensed Patent and of any Licensed Product is assumed by the Company on behalf of the Licensed Entities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Except for COMPANY’S indemnification obligations under Section 8.D oR 8.E, (I) nEITHER pARTY will be liable to THE OTHER PARTY or any Licensed Entity for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, punitive or any other damages or losses of any kind or nature, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), products or strict liability or any other form of action; AND (II) IN NO EVENT WILL UNIVERSITY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT TO ALL LICENSED ENTITIES AND OTHER PERSONS AND ENTITIES EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY COMPANY TO UNIVERSITY HEREUNDER. The above limitations on liability apply even though the University Indemnified Person may have been advised of the possibility of such injury, loss or damage. Company shall not, and shall cause all other Licensed Entities not to, make any agreements, statements, representations or warranties or accept any liabilities or responsibilities whatsoever with regard to any person or entity which are inconsistent with this Section 8.F.

Specifically:       1. Sublicense (page 4, section 2.C):  The company requested that we strike “insurance” from the list of obligations that a sublicense would have to HHMI, with the following comment:  “While we are willing to accommodate HHMI’s requests, per our consultation with several insurance companies, we cannot obtain an insurance naming HHMI as the additional insured in China, and cannot agree to request a sublicense to do so.”     2. HHMI Indemnification (page 21, section 8.D.):   The company has made a language change that needs HHMI review.           As you’ll see from the redline, we still have some fairly significant issues to resolve, so we aren’t yet at the point of being able to provide you with a “near complete” version for review.

22-A-009,Active,Exclusive License,"Hi Thelma,     I’m sorry for not responding sooner. Because of the volume of agreements we review, HHMI doesn’t typically review licensing agreements until we receive a near final agreement for entry into our system that we can review in its totality. I will need to review the entire Leading Edge agreement once it is ready. I can, however, comment on your questions:     1. Insurance should remain in the list of obligations for sublicensees. If the license requires that Chicago be added as an additional insured, then HHMI must be added as an additional insured. If the license doesn’t require that Chicago be added as an additional insured, HHMI doesn’t have to be added as an additional insured. We just have to make sure that the insurance policy is in effect and covers HHMI and we would expect as much for a sublicensee, hence why insurance should remain in the list for sublicensing purposes.  2.

Company shall deliver to University stock certificate(s) representing the shares issued to University in connection with any Financing Closing within 15 days after such Financing Closing. For purposes of this Section 3.A the term “Outstanding Shares” shall mean, as of a given date, the sum of: (a) the number of shares of Company’s common stock outstanding as of such date (including the shares of Company common stock to be issued to University on such date); (b) the number of shares of Company’s common stock into which all outstanding shares of Company’s preferred stock as of such date could be converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding such date; (c) the number of shares of Company’s common stock into which any warrant or other right to subscribe for or purchase any common stock or preferred stock of Company, including the conversion of any convertible notes, outstanding as of such date could be converted if fully exercised and converted on the day immediately preceding such date, and (d) the number of shares of Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of all options to purchase Company’s common stock outstanding as of such date of Company if fully exercised on the day immediately preceding such date.   The stock purchase agreement will contain provisions:    i.                 specifying that, with respect only to a Qualified Financing, if the Company proposes to sell any equity securities or securities that are convertible into equity securities of the Company, then University and/or its Assignee (as defined below) will have the right to purchase up to ten percent (10%) of the securities issued in each offering on the same terms and conditions as are offered to the other purchasers in such Qualified Financing. Company shall provide twenty (20) days advanced written notice of such Qualified Financing, including reasonable detail regarding the terms and purchasers in the financing. The term “Assignee” means: (a) any person or entity to which University’s participation rights under Section 3.A have been assigned either by University or another entity, or (b) any entity that is controlled by University.

Can you confirm that’s fine from MBL’s perspective? 2. On the at-cost systems:  John would like to compromise on 1 stand alone system or 2 bench top systems provided at cost; the rest cost + 20%.   Can you confirm if MBL accepts? 3. There are several sections in the attached SRA that I flagged for your review, as I do not have domain over them in SRAs.    Specifically, these are Sections 2.6 and 8.2.    Iwaki has also asked for mutual indemnification in the SRA, and I can’t comment on that – it’s MBL’s decision.   Perhaps these are sections for you to discuss with Stefan Jellicoe?

For your information – I plan to add this license agreement to the end of the SRA as a form that can be executed for future IP, but if we have existing technical info, I can also execute a license now for that.

I have reached out to Stefan Jellicoe for his input on mutual warranty. I’ve gotten no response. My primary question is how far reaching the clauses 2.6 and 8 are. Do they apply only to the SRA, or do they extend into the commercial product? If we are accepting this risk for a period of two years max while the prototype is delivered, that’s a much easier obstacle than if we are accepting risk even after the product hits the market.

21-A-053,Active,Exclusive License,"Thelma,     I’ve reviewed the docs for our Inflectis stock allocation.  Can you confirm that per the license agreement we are to receive common shares worth €306,670? We are receiving series “O” shares, which are basically common stock.     The documents are pretty atypical from what we see for U.S companies, but most of the same features and concepts are still there.  In addition to O shares, the company also has a few series of preferred shares with preference ahead of the O shares in liquidation, merger and stock sales.  Per the bylaws, all shares, including O shares, come with subscription rights to purchase a pro rata share of future stock issuances by the company.  Preferred shareholders have full ratchet subscription rights, but O shares do not.     Holders of O shares do not have the information, access or audit rights given to preferred shareholders.  If we have information rights in our license agreement, this may not be a problem.  Otherwise, you could ask for them in a side arrangement.       There is a shareholders agreement, amended various times, that includes pre-emptive rights, tag-along rights, drag along rights, and transfer restrictions.  None of the terms are unusual or especially disadvantageous to holders of O shares.     In summary, I did not see anything here that should give Polsky concerns about accepting the shares.

21-A-053,Active,Exclusive License,"Hi Russ,     Thanks for your quick review of this!     To answer your question on how many shares we should receive the license stated that we would receive 3,370 shares of common stock, which represented 1% of the company at the time:     A.     Common Stock Grant. Following the Effective Date, Company shall irrevocably issue to University, in partial consideration of Company’s receipt of the licenses granted under this Agreement, three thousand three hundred seventy (3,370) shares of common stock, representing one percent (1%) of the outstanding common and preferred shares, on a fully diluted basis, of Company on the Effective Date, after accounting for the equity issued pursuant to Company’s latest fundraising for an amount of € 8,196,057.40 (including new equity investments and conversions of past shareholder debt into equity) and for the 2,362 French Tech Bridge OBSA share subscription warrants and the 16,851 BSPCE 2021-1 founder share subscription warrants / BSA 2021-2 share subscription warrants issued or to be issued by the Company following the Company’s latest fundraising. The shares issued to University shall be common stock with the same rights and obligations as the shares of common stock owned by the Company’s founders. To enable University to subscribe for these new shares, Company shall owe University an additional consideration of € 306,670 that shall be due and payable by Company to University on the Effective Date, it being understood that this consideration shall in no event be paid in cash but shall be allocated by University exclusively to subscribing for the new shares issued pursuant to this Section 3. B by way of set off between the consideration due to University and the amount due by University to pay up its newly issued 3,370 shares of common stock.        It looks like section 2.2 of the UChicago Accession agreement did specify the 3,370 shares, so if that number of shares is still consistent with the expected 1% as of the effective date (which was 6/18/2021), I think that’s right.

However, the agreement language is more specific than the information we have. For instance, they have demonstrated in vivo efficacy in two disease models – cancer and atherosclerosis. However, I don’t know if the models they used are considered “industry standard”. In addition, I know they have designed/tested different versions of the DNA nanodevice, none of which outcompetes the original version. So, I don’t know if any of these modified nanodevices “may be a Licensed Product”. I think it’s worth verifying with Lev. He would be candid about it.     • Establish in vivo efficacy in at least one disease model using an industry standard animal model within 1 year of Effective Date.  • Design and test a modified DNA nanodevice that may be a Licensed Product within 1.5 years of Effective Date.

A nonexclusive technical information license for the following technologies:   a. 15-T-055  b. 17-T-012  c. 17-T-014  d. 17-T-017  e. 19-T-141  f. 18-T-094  g. 18-T-673  h. 18-T-217  i. 19-T-165     19-T-165 was not included in Schedule A because there are no patents; we could only license the technical information and any associated tangible materials.  (This is because the PI published the technology before she disclosed it, so we couldn’t file.)  So, it’s listed in Schedule F (“Technical Information”) but not Schedule A (“Patents”).  It should be categorized in Minuet as “non-exclusively licensed.”           One thing to note on this license, however, is that the sales of licensed products should be identified by what sensor was sold.  This license includes a long list of sensors.   So we will need to look at the sales reports and determine what was sold, so we can match the royalties to the appropriate technologies.       For instance, I noticed on the December 2021 royalty report that the company listed “CalipHluor” on the Report Type:       I believe the relevant techs for this are 18-T-094, 18-T-217, and 18-T-673.   But I’m copying in Han to confirm – she’s the tech expert on this portfolio!     I am also attaching a (dated) spreadsheet that I used to figure out how Yamuna’s portfolio mapped.  I think Han may have an updated version of this.  The reason this is relevant is because I put the name of the sensors in Column N, and the tech ID is in Column D.  So, if the company identifies which sensors are associated with the royalties, we can match them to the technology.      Happy to meet and discuss this one, if helpful!

Things are a bit dicey here with the UK forecasted to be coming out of the EU in the next few weeks. So changes afoot for both our nations. But on the bright side – it’s Diwali so trying to celebrate the best we can in the midst of our second lock down. : )     Please find the license agreement updated. The changes are also called out below.      1. Section 2A Deletion – Accepted your amendments and agree on the duplication in 2.H. Have updated Section 7.B to reflect the same 90 days notice period for consistency.  2. Section 2H – added unless a mutual exception is agreed. Accepted all other edits. 3. Section 4A - Accepted your modifications. Added ‘until the First Commercial Sale’ as once we’ve successfully commercialised, after which we’ll switch to general investor reporting covered under 5.H as mentioned in your comment. Also removed the first as redundant, updated first 2 years to one year since we are providing annual updates anyhow. (Schedule D - Deleted ‘Research & Development, Current status of Licensed Products in development: and Plans for future research and development regarding Licensed Products’ from the progress report in Schedule D as it is duplicative with 4.A now) 4. Section 4B deleted in light of reintroduction of 4A making this duplicative.  5. 5A – Lab notebooks - This is hugely company confidential and be documenting new inventions etc. What is the reason for this reintroduction? 6. Regarding the insurance we would prefer to be more specific on the requirements, in line with the standard insurance products available in the market – we have employers liability (10Million) and professional indemnity insurance GBP 2,000,000. Our labs are in the UK so our insurance covers our current operations and facilities. Once we have a commercial product we will add product liability insurance for the regions (eg: US) where we will sell these product. Additionally, Insurance Policies are normally always capped – so we would recommend the wording in the license agreement to reflect: (a) limiting the geographic scope to where we have operations and where we are actively selling Products, (b) the need for product liability insurance to only come in upon the first commercial sale, and (c) liability caps ideally in line with what we currently have.

21-A-079,Active,Exclusive License,"Hi Dhivya,     Well, looks like the election was settled (hooray!) but the craziness hasn’t exactly subsided.   Things will be interesting stateside for the next few months, it appears!     I’ve attached the license agreement with some proposed changes.  Some were fixes (thank you for catching these).        On the two remaining substantive issues:  1. Development plan – I’ve proposed some alternate language that hopefully is more acceptable to Esya, and aligns with plans that Esya is already making and could just share with the University to keep us updated on its plans for developing the licensed products.    2. Insurance – we have never done a license without insurance provisions before, so I think it’s unlikely that the University will agree to strike this provision entirely.   I’ve reached out to our insurance counsel to see if there is some alternate language that we could include here for Esya to review, but in the meantime, I have to reserve this section until they have commented.        Let me know if these changes are acceptable to Esya, and I will keep you posted as I hear back from our insurance counsel.

21-A-079,Active,Exclusive License,"Hi Dhivya,     Thank you for your thoughtful redline and helpful comments.   I think we’re nearly there.   I’ve put my notes in red, and an updated license is attached.        1. Section 2A Deletion – Accepted your amendments and agree on the duplication in 2.H. Have updated Section 7.B to reflect the same 90 days notice period for consistency.   Accepted changes to 7.B.    2. Section 2H – added unless a mutual exception is agreed. Accepted all other edits.

(Schedule D - Deleted ‘Research & Development, Current status of Licensed Products in development: and Plans for future research and development regarding Licensed Products’ from the progress report in Schedule D as it is duplicative with 4.A now)  Accepted.   4. Section 4B deleted in light of reintroduction of 4A making this duplicative.     Since 4A now only addresses development up to first commercial sale, this section is needed, as it is relevant for the time after sales have started. We need to be able to ensure that the Licensed Products aren’t sidelined in favor of other products, leaving university with no way to make sure they are receiving fair treatment in terms of effort to get them deployed on the market, and no way to part ways with the company in the event that the product is sidelined.   That isn’t so important when the relationship is between UChicago and Esya as we know you are focusing hard on developing the technology, but if Esya is someday acquired by Millipore or another big company, this would be  key protection for the technology.      5. 5A – Lab notebooks - This is hugely company confidential and be documenting new inventions etc. What is the reason for this reintroduction?  As Technical Information is included in the license now, we need to be able to see laboratory notebooks to confirm if a product was developed using the licensed Technical Information.  This information would only be used for the purpose of the audit to confirm compliance with this agreement.        6.

I have included some provisional modifications that I received from our insurance counsel that are pending confirmation from our other counsel.   These changes don’t specify the details of coverage to be maintained, and suggests that the company is  responsible for assessing what is adequate to cover obligations borne by the agreement, including the IP license and any resulting product. Hopefully this helps to mitigate some of the concerns.   I am still waiting for our second counsel review, but wanted to get the draft back to you, so we can hopefully wrap the rest of the items up while I wait to hear back from him!

21-A-079,Active,Exclusive License,"Hi Thema,      Thank you for coming back to us so promptly and I so agree. I think we’re nearly there.      We’ve accepted all your proposals and proposed an insurance clause to ensure clarity on the insurance expectations from Esya. The rewording is as follows, which is a pragmatic way of phrasing this that allows us to comply with the requirements in the paragraph:     Company agrees, and will cause each other Licensed Entity to agree, to continuously maintain during the term of this Agreement employers liability, professional indemnity, and upon commercialization product liability insurance, subject to customary insurance liability caps. At University’s request, Company will supply University from time to time with evidence of such policy(ies).          In addition Section 8C indemnifies the university and your related entities, which combined with the above should suffice in terms of protection for you.      The last point we need to resolve is the matter of deferred Patent costs until we hit $1M in revenue, allowing us to invest the same money in revenue generating activities. This will make such a difference to our company taking off in these early stages and thus really important to Yamuna and I, so we’re hoping for a favourable response on this point.

21-A-079,Active,Exclusive License,"HI Dhivya,     We heard back from our insurance counsel, who accepted much of Esya’s proposed insurance language, and provided some edits in the attached.   Hopefully this is agreeable to Esya – I’m not sure if we have any more wiggle room on this provision, as I understand from our counsel.     Regarding the patent cost deferment – I discussed this with our leadership, and we can continue to defer the patent costs that were incurred prior to November, 2017.  In the earlier license, this deferment was for the earlier of a Series A investment or the 30 month anniversary of the effective date.   As we will have a new effective date for this license, that will give the company an additional 18+ months of runway on that payment, if you are still working on a Series A.     The language that is currently in the agreement provides for this time adjustment.     However, we can’t agree to defer ongoing patent costs until the company is generating product-related revenue.  As you can probably understand, this is for a number of reasons.  One of the biggest is that we have many faculty-founded companies that hold patent licenses, and it isn’t financially feasible or responsible from an asset management perspective for the University to float patent costs for undetermined amounts of time for all of them.

I don’t see any reason that the licensee wouldn’t be responsible for this one.       On the other hand, for such a small amount, it may not be worth pursuing.

21-A-123,Active,Exclusive License,"Dear Laurent,  I apologize for taking this long to respond, our fiscal year end was June 30th and I have been extremely busy.  I will try to address your questions.   1. In the contract, it is stated that Patent Costs incurred prior to Jan 10 are 4,046.5USD, which is in line with the details you provided (vendor invoice number 2040830 and 2045126). Yet it seems you are billing costs that are beyond the definition of Patent Costs, for a total amount of 2,980USD prior to this cut-off date, and 10,153.5USD in total. I note that US prosecution and US filing fees incurred prior to Jan 10, 2021 are not part of the Patent Costs summed in the contract and were therefore assumed to be excluded from Patent Costs       RESPONSE:  Per the terms of the license:     7.C.i.  Company shall pay all Patent Costs incurred by University prior to the Effective Date (which is April 2, 2021).  Such payment is due and payable upon execution of this Agreement by Company. (For the avoidance of doubt, approximately $4,046.50 in Patent Costs has been incurred by University prior to January 10, 2021).  The effective date is April 2, 2021 so all costs through that date are due.    When we are negotiating licenses it can take a bit of time, so when those negotiations start we share how much the historic patents costs are at that moment to give the licensee an idea of costs and so they are not suddenly surprised if the amounts are high.  This is not what will be owed unless the effective date was January 10, 2021.       2. Could you please confirm that no other invoices related to the patent will be incurred? My understanding is that we are handling this directly now.     RESPONSE:  I cannot 100% guarantee that we will not receive any more correspondence or bills for the 2 Provisionals that we filed because neither has expired (one expires 8/7/21 and the other expires 12/18/2021).  So, even though AB Science filed a PCT that incorporates the 2 PROs, our attorney may still send an expiration letter or reminder letter.  HOWEVER, if that happens, it would be a very small bill or none at all.     I have attached the two outstanding invoices, which you have made a partial payment on the historic invoice.

We are just trying to align the license language with the IIA amendment.

At-Cost Purchases (Section 2.F on page 7) a. Without any reasonable restrictions, this would enable the University to obtain product at cost and sell to private industry (big pharma) for profit. Our position is that this is unreasonable and we would opt for limiting this to special situations involving non-commercial research. b. Our proposed solution is to keep our suggested language limiting to non-commercial research purposes.  2. Diligence (Section 4 on page 11 and Schedule D on page 29) a. Calidi needs the standard to be commercially reasonable efforts. We are intending to bring a licensed to product through clinical trials as quickly as possible but we need some reasonable room to meet the Schedule D timelines for events that are outside our control such as patient enrollment, acquisition of necessary amounts of material, etc.  3. Representations (Section 8.B on page 20) a. Our understanding is that COHâ€™s IND is close to being active with a few questions being answered to the FDA. We would like for a representation that this IND will be active upon the execution of the definitive agreement.   b. Also, we need a representation that University has the authority to bind the other institutions in this agreement (City of Hope/University of Alabama). 4. Publicity (Section 9.H on page 24) a. We would like to afford University of Chicago a 30 day window to review and comment on any press release or public announcement of the licensing deal but for Calidi to have ultimate final approval on its own press with regard to the deal.

The ultimate pharma partner might chose such a route, but to be compelled to such a route is an entirely separate matter.  It really takes away the exclusivity of the license.

If we have questions, do we ask UCSF or talk to Celgene directly? a. UCSF if still the lead.Â Â  We moved to direct deposit info because UCSF only pays out once a year, and the PIs at Toronto and UC were irritated that it took so long to get their checks.Â  UCSF should be the one to contact if you have any questions.  2.

22-A-068,Active,Exclusive License,"HI Doreen,  I’m not sure what you were told, so don’t know whether or not it contradicts; sorry!   The calculation is not specified in the license, but the licenses are each for different IP.     There are four different licenses.  3 are for IP that were developed in the first RAN collaboration (RAN1), which went from 2015-2019.  The fourth and most recent one is for IP that was developed under RAN2.  Different people in Tony’s lab participated at different levels throughout both RAN1 and (current) RAN2.  In order to figure out how to allocate revenue in an equitable way – based on their contribution to the project – this spreadsheet was developed and all parties have signed informed consents about this revenue allocation (these are in Minuet).   The spreadsheet allocates shares to each participant per year by their level of contribution (which is either 1,2, or 3).      RAN 1 is completed, so there will be no changes in any person’s shares for licenses to IP developed under RAN1.   So, for the first three licenses (which are RAN1 licenses), Annika Saaf, for instance, will always receive revenue based on her adjusted shares of 14.15, and Jude Luke will always receive revenue based on her adjusted shares of 8.49.     RAN 2 is still ongoing, so shares may change over time as people come on and off the project.  We currently have two years’ worth of shares accumulated, so the payment for the new license (22-A-068) will be distributed according to the shares calculation we have at the moment; we can’t predict what people will do for the next three years.  So, right now, Annika Saaf has a total of 6 shares (adjusted to 14 to normalize), but if she leaves she won’t accumulate any additional shares and her relative distribution may decrease compared to others who stay.  If she stays and continues to participate at the highest level, she’ll accumulate a total of 15 shares by the end of the project.      I thought that the previous license payments were $449,550 due to some UCSF nickel and diming, so I’d just imported that number into the RAN2 calculation.   I’ve adjusted it to 450K on the RAN sheet in the attached and adjusted the calculations per person accordingly.      Also just flagging that “TK” allocation in the rows at the bottom are the calculations for Tony Kossiakoff’s distribution.   He’s separate from the pool.   I hope that helps – let me know if it would be helpful to hop on a call to discuss.  I’m out next week but could talk today or 1st week in Jan.

22-A-103,Active,Non-Exclusive License,"Hi Teana,      Yes, you are absolutely right in that this agreement was developed from an agreement last year between U Chicago and BD for Dr. Fitch’s HK1.4 clone. As you know from the email threads, the key differences in terms of this contract is a reduced $3,000 upfront payment as this market is 75% smaller than the market for Dr. Fitch’s HK1.4 clone. However, on November 30th Michelle noticed an issue with the “Net Sales” language. Specifically, Net Sales reported by BD does not take into account sales from 3rd party resellers and distributors. In some jurisdictions with markets outside of the US, having access to and sharing sales reports of “preferred vendors” is perceived as an attempt at price fixing or market manipulation I one for or another. To address this issue, which also came up last year with Matthew Brown and the HK1.4 clone. To better address this issue on this new contract, Michelle requested that modify the language in the last sentence the language in the Net Sales paragraph on the bottom of Page 2, right below Section I-iv.  Specifically, she suggest modifying the language to “For the avoidance of doubt, distributors and re-sellers are not transferees.” Therefore, distributors and resellers sales numbers have no direct implications on the agreed royalty rates we receive directly from BD, in their capacity as a merchant of the product produced by the clone they licensed from us, for their distributors and resellers. Moving forward with this contract, we will require that the previous contract (the November contract), will need to be terminated before the new is executed. I hope that makes a sliver of sense, but given your level of experience with these agreements, you probably only needed one or two sentences to get the gist what’s going on, so this explanation was more so for developing my understanding than it was assuaging your confusion, lol.

Two questions about the trademark agreement:      1. I see that To&Through is listed on it. While we helped in the early days of To&Through, notably getting the data tool developed and off the ground, the To&Through Project does not reside under Impact. Instead, it is housed under UEI as a collaborative effort between the Project itself and the Consortium. There are not currently any plans to fold it under Impact, but down the road that may change. Given this, should we keep the To&Through mark on this agreement just in case or would it be better to remove it? 2. We have a third, emerging product known as Cultivate (this is the product that came from the Becoming Effective Learners work that is referenced in the License Agreement). I’m not sure we have a mark on this yet, but it would be good to do that, to the extent possible, and then get it on this agreement.

Since these agreements have been in place for quite a while, we’d like to suggest a longer term of 20 yrs. 3. Finally, to help reduce administrative burden, we’d like propose having payments due annually instead of quarterly.      Please do not hesitate to reach out if there are any questions.

Over the course of multiple conversations with Tim Honaker, who managed the license agreement, and Dr. Scott Stern, the lead faculty inventor, several years ago we discussed the options of terminating the license or keeping the license but just hosting the content for free for Dr. Stern's goals of making his materials more publicly available. We informally agreed to keep hosting it, as long as their were no costs or work required (beyond our own internal server and hosting costs) with no intent to commercialize further, as goodwill to the faculty who are actively working in this space. If its problematic from a licensing perspective, it may make sense to loop in Scott Stern and Tim, if he's still involved, on best next steps.

In addition, I believe every SCC Inc. board member but Debbie Leslie resigned when Bob and I were let go. So it may take a meeting of a new SCC Inc. board and a resolution to allow someone else to have access before you can work with Chase to find the account and allow someone else to access.

However, I thought we were able to deduct inventor share first, then 50/50 to HHMI.  Bendelac is the only inventor and I don’t see any split (85/15 or otherwise on file).  So, 10% to JAX, then 25% to inventor, then 50/50 with HHMI.     That is NOT correct.  Jackson labs gets 10% off the top and then EVERY one else shares the remaining by their normal %, in other words the PI(s)  get 22.5% not 25%.

This and next month I will be in and out of the office, taking 1-2 days off/week on average.  Thank you for sending a draft for our review. Before I submit it to my Legal team, I have a few questions/comments:   1. Could you confirm which applications this clone has been tested for and what were the results? The reason I am asking is that our main interest is in ELISA. If there are other applications in which it works, then even better, but without ELISA we probably wouldn't license it. 2. Could you explain what do you mean by $1,000 of annual fee before commercial use? Do you mean that for every 12-months after the effective date, if we haven't launched the product yet, we have to pay $1,000? We have seen similar clauses before but only for exclusive licenses with patent protection. CST doesn't typically accept minimum annual payments for non-exclusive licenses, for RUO, without patent protection especially when the expected revenue is on the lower end like in this case. It is just an ROI decision. 3. If #1 and #2 above check out, for the $10,000 upfront fee we would rather have a 15-year license. Otherwise, the ROI may not be worth it for this target.

I agree with you that the 2nd Amended and Restated license currently housed under AGR12156 should really be AGR12072.   Also, the 3rd Amended and restated that is housed under AGR12156 should also be under AGR12072.  If we really want to be technical, all of them should have stayed under AGR11909 – I don’t know why so many different AGRs were created for the same license group.     As I read it – this is what happened:   AGR11909 – we entered into an AGR with PharmaFrontiers (PF) on 2/20/2004;  PF was a start up and immediately had problems AGR11939 – on December 20, 2004, we entered into an Amended and Restated license with PF.  They had 4 Amendments to this AGR, and in June of 2006, PF changed its name to Opexa.   AGR12072/AGR12156– We entered into 2nd, Amended and Restated Agreement with Opexa on 7/31/2007.  However, for some reason the 2nd was put under AGR12156 – which is the buyout agreement of Opexa by Novartis.  This is a mistake – the  2nd, 3rd and 4th should be under AGR12072. AGR12156 – Opexa was purchased by Novartis Institute for BioMedical Research; they entered into a separate Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement on 8/6/2009.  This could also be put under AGR12072 – but again, I am not sure why these were all mapped out separately.   Let me know if this helps – or if this is more confusing!

16-A-141,Terminated,Exclusive License,"Dear Stockholders,       As you are aware, we have been in discussions to sell ExplORer Surgical to Global Healthcare Exchange, LLC (GHX).   I am quite pleased to let you know that we have successfully concluded those negotiations, and the Merger Agreement and the material ancillary transaction agreements have been approved by the Board of Directors of ExplORer Surgical and signed by the parties.  Please note the action that our stockholders are required to take, highlighted below, on or before the close of business on Tuesday, October 5.       The Merger Agreement, along with the referenced ancillary agreements, is included for your information in the attached zip file.  To summarize, the final base sales price for 100% of the stock and outstanding options is $39,000,000, subject to customary adjustments for cash, debt, working capital and transaction expenses, and represents a substantial return for our stockholders and option holders.   Out of this purchase price, we will use approximately $7,500,000 to pay off our existing Convertible Promissory Notes and transaction expenses (including investment banking, counsel and accountant fees and expenses).  We will also be required to set aside in escrow for a period of 18 months following closing the amount of $195,000 against any potential indemnification claims.  We will also have a separate escrow of $75,000 for potential and customary adjustments to Net Working Capital.       GHX has acquired representation and warranty insurance for this transaction.  As a result, absent claims of fraud, the indemnification obligations of the Company are generally limited to the escrow amounts noted above.       For the convenience of all of our stockholders, we have appointed Fortis Advisors to serve as the stockholders’ representative for purposes of any post-closing disputes or actions that may arise under the Merger Agreement.  To support that work, we have agreed to withhold $50,000 from the transaction proceeds to support any expenses incurred by Fortis Advisors in that role.  Aphelion Capital, our original lead investor, has graciously agreed to have an affiliated entity serve as advisor to Fortis Group in order to review, direct and approve any actions taken by Fortis Group in connection with the Merger Agreement.       Also attached is the text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which describes appraisal rights which are available to stockholders that do not approve the Merger Agreement.   We are providing this to inform you of your rights and meet the Company’s disclosure obligations under Delaware law.       Last,  we are required by the Merger Agreement to obtain consent for the Merger Agreement from holders of at least 75% of our voting securities on or before the close of business on October 5, 2021.  Attached is the requested form of Stockholder Consent.  This Consent approves the Merger Agreement in the form approved by the Board, as well as the appointment of Fortis and the designation of the Aphelion entity to serve as advisor to Fortis.       We ask that you please sign the attached Stockholder Consent and return it to me via email as soon as possible, but in any event by the morning of Tuesday, October 5.  If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know right away and I will connect you with ExplORer Surgical counsel for the transaction.

16-A-184,Terminated,Exclusive License,"Hi Fred,     Could we touch base by phone about these reports?  Specifically, if you and I can go over the product(s) and attribute which IPs are incorporated, that would be great.  Some information UC needs should shake out of that discussion:     1. UC needs to break down the sales by specific technology/agreement, or confirm that all technologies are part of a single commercial product.  This is because the university both reports out to the government and/or relevant sponsors what technology is incorporated into what product, and we distribute revenue to our scientists according to inventorship.  I can review the relevant patents with you live in context with a product description if that helps.     2. First commercial sale dates for each of the technologies/agreements     3. 16-A-184 particularly has a $10k minimum that was theoretically due 12/31/2020.

We’ve now reviewed the draft and have made a couple of amendments for your review.  Please see attached.      The changes are:     *         We added language to help clarify that there are no additional costs to CSL in relation to preparation of the Licensed Materials.    *         Under 2.5 – We’ve reverted this to allow transfer to more than one third party.  Typically we need to work with multiple sub-contractors for a given research project, and therefore cannot be limited to providing the Licensed Material to a single sub-contractor.  However, we’re happy to notify Chicago of each new subcontractor so Chicago can keep track. We hope this addresses any concern that Chicago may have. We also think this is reasonable considering the amount of the licence fee.  *         On further discussion with the team, we’ve included a new clause 2.8 in case Chicago cannot deliver the Licensed Materials within a 3 month time frame (following payment of the license fee).      *         Under 4.1, our finance policy requires 60 days payment term (apologies this should have been included previously).

22-A-047,Terminated,Non-Exclusive License,"Dear Thelma,     I hope this email finds you well. I am contacting you on behalf of CSL in regards to CD1 mice for which CSL and The University of Chicago have entered into a License Agreement (attached FYI).     While the agreement was executed in September 2021 and a license fee of USD65,000 paid, CSL has not received any material. It is my current understanding that the animals’ health condition created an issue for the transfer.  At this stage, CSL still requires access to the mice we paid for and we have identified that the University of Melbourne has very recently received a shipment of CD1 mice from Northwestern that would be suitable for CSL once rederived. We are then seeking permission from Chicago to have the University of Melbourne rederive these CD1 mice for CSL’s use( under a service agreement; which will need to be negotiated such that each parties rights to these rederived mice are not in conflict with the terms of our respective license (CSL) and MTA (UoM)).     We hope The University of Chicago will look favourably at our request. Considering the year long delay in accessing the licensed material, we would also be seeking a one year extension of the current license agreement for free.
