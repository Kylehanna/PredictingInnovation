The idea is that it can replace single cell RNA sequencing to identify maladaptive cellular interactions and populations of inflammatory cells. Specific information on cellular architecture and the organization of inflammatory cellular networks can be identified with the invention but is lost with current methods.    Which autoimmune disorders does it diagnose? In a combination of mouse models and retrospective clinical biopsies, the technology was tested on lupus. It is hypothesized that it could also be applied to evaluating cancer patient sensitivity to chemotherapy as a companion diagnostic.   What kind of tissue samples does this work with? This would depend on the disease being diagnosed. For the proof of concept with lupus, they used renal biopsy samples.    Does that help answer your questions? I hope it does! Let me know if you have further questions or need anything else. I am copying Brittany Butler on this email, she is the licensing manager on this technology.

We are available 12-2PM and 3-4PM Central.    Quickly following up about BridgeBio:  BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers, and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source. The team includes Neil Kumar, Phil Reilly, Charles Homcy, and Richard Scheller.  BridgeBio was founded in 2015 to identify and advance transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from Mendelian diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers. BridgeBio’s pipeline of over 16 development programs includes product candidates ranging from early discovery to late-stage development.  Two-thirds of the programs are based on licensed technology from academic research institutions – e.g., Eidos Therapeutics (Stanford University), CoA (Saint Jude Children’s Research Hospital), Aspa (University of Massachusetts).  BridgeBio pursues company creation, licensing, and sponsored research, and can be quite flexible depending on what works the best for the institution and the investigator.  Areas of interest • Diseases with a genetic basis (e.g., Mendelian diseases, repeat expansion diseases, cancers driven by genomic translocation or gain-of-function allele) • Therapy directly targets or compensates for the underlying genetic target  (e.g., directly inhibits a gain-of-function protein, replaces a loss-of-function protein, or directly activates a homolog of the defective protein)     • Any therapeutic modality (e.g., small molecule, recombinant protein, gene therapy, monoclonal antibody, RNAi)  Examples of studies eligible for sponsored research funding and preferred stage of development • Further development of novel therapies (e.g., small molecule screening using biophysical assays, structure activity relationship optimization of lead compounds, antibody optimization, investigating chemical modifications on lead biologic, optimization of viral vectors, biophysical assay development) • Testing efficacy of therapeutic in relevant animal models and/or patient-derived cell lines  • Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies  Please find the attached presentation overviewing our leadership, mission, and pipeline.

The technology works by analyzing T Cell shape and size to determine if there are cognate interactions occurring with neighboring antigen presenting cells, and uses this data as the basis of the diagnosis. There would still be the need for the kidney biopsy sample, the main advantage is the high throughout way in which the samples can be analyzed compared to manual analysis. There is extensive in vivo proof of concept data right now using mouse models of Lupus.   Right now the current standard is manual analysis of stained confocal microscopy samples by a pathologist, so this is a tool that can be used to speed throughput.   If you are more interested in biomarkers that would eliminate the need for the invasive kidney biopsy sample as a companion diagnostic, this is very useful feedback that we can relay to the inventors.

In the meantime I can provide some more detailed context.  Our model is essentially one of a freelance EIR - we read over technologies, discuss them internally, and do some further research by contacting tech managers, inventors, and potential customers.  If there's enough interest on all sides, we form a company in which we own an equity stake (but usually not a majority) and start doing fundraising using a variety of methods, including federal (i-Corps, SBIR/STTRs, etc - we've done three i-Corps and had 2 successful STTRs), private grants (usually state based - we've raised over $100k from them in various states) and private financing (Raised over $1m from a variety of angel and VC investors).  We then help the business on a project management / business development side and work closely with someone with technical expertise to move the technology toward the milestones necessary to become a commercial product.  We bring on a significant network of lawyers, accountants, FDA consultants, industrial designers, funding sources and others that are necessary to help move products to market.  We don't pay ourselves until we have either raised some money from a financing round or a federal/state grant, and our interests are completely aligned with the company as we own equity in it.  We then help the company grow as quickly as we can.  I hope all of that makes sense.  I'll be traveling Friday but should be generally available for the rest of the week and into next week.

What we are wondering is if there is any application of this approach for other chronic fibrotic type of conditions such as chronic kidney disease/fibrosis.  Is there any in vitro or in vivo experiment that may speak to relevance in reversing chronic kidney disease? If so a small experiment showing positive effects would make this interested in pursuing further.   Vaccines 15-T-04: I did my thesis research on polymer adjuvants for vaccines so this one hit close to home.  The mouse data seems intriguing but we would need to see some more data that indicates that this system might lead to an extended protective immunity or beneficial aspects of stabilizing antigens or formulation. More relevant pathogens to us that could be of interest would be Eimeria, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, or in combination with modified live virus vaccines as potential studies that would lead to more interest from us as well as potentially move forward a human health focused research program.  Parasiticide (MRSA) Small Molecule 12-T-059: Good early MIC data but we would like to see the translation into some in vivo experiments showing efficacy in alleviating disease from Staph.   Parasiticide (SSTI) Small Molecule 10-T-108: Similar response as above but maybe continued work in refining to obtain a better in vivo survival response before we would be ready to engage.   Parasiticide (Sepsis) Small Molecules 16-T-097: This one is intriguing as there may be application in allergy in dogs and cats which is a rapidly expanding market.

       " '2:05 PM Jamie introduced himself after Ray joined. Talked about kits, research tools, that Millipore has licensed. Interest from PNAS paper and perhaps expand on Duolink. Interested in hearing the technology from Ray’s own words.  2:07 PM Ray: Nature Communications paper was the earlier paper to progression to the PNAS paper. In ‘omics space there is a need for higher resolution. Chemical probes were developed to understand protein function. They were nice from a purely discovery view – low input low resolution. Ray was interested in single cell single state resolution without a new probe every time without a new chemical entity every time. Integrate oligonucleotide barcodes and chemical functionality approach to image single activity each time. Move away from Duolink’s approach with multiple antibodies to make modular. Imaging was described in Nature Comms but PNAS showed small samples. Use proximity approach to get signal. Barcode multiplex in full solution. This approach can do target ID and quantify, monitor multiple things in a sample. High throughput phenotyping application. Readout can be qPCR, sequencing, digital droplet, etc. Where we’re going? The sensitivity can be done in single cell solution base, like CTCs or joining it with microfluidics. Enzyme activity pathology – rather than staining for one target, we can look at the activity of many enzymes. Probes are modular so we can target other protein families. Looking at clinical diagnostics.   2:14 PM Jamie: Single cell – how high of a plex can you go?   2:15 PM Ray:  we haven’t hit the ceiling yet. See PNAS paper. Since it’s targeting families, it can look within and between families of proteins.  2:16 PM Jamie: any competing technology besides Duolink?  2:16 PM Ray: The closest thing looking at abundance of proteins other than Duolink, there’s really nothing in the activity space. One of the limitations of dual antibody PLA is that you need at least two antibodies and it needs two epitopes. If you are only interested in the abundance in the protein, ADPL has greater success because we only need one good antibody. The probe gets the active site the antibody gets the other. Other than Duolink I don’t think there’s anything else out there.   2:20 PM Jamie asked about IP; SN to send Jamie the PCT.  Ray: we design the system with probes that already exist. Mostly activity is looking at lysate which has problems. Probes need to traverse the cell membrane which ours can or developed so they have the properties. The modular pieces will fit into our system. Other groups are looking with probes using ADPLs. Making other handles like biotin. Some probes can work that are already out there, but our probes can be a one size fit all for certain families. New probes being developed  2:23 PM: Jamie: How many probes have been made?  2:23 PM Ray: We’ve used probes that we know the profile. We’ve benchmarked on known probes. These probes don’t have to be activity dependent as long as it’s something that recognizes the target of interest.  2:25 PM Jamie: you don’t really have to really fine-tune. Is it turnkey?  2:25 PM Ray: It’s pretty turnkey. Clinicians say activity is pretty important. Chemical probes are easy to scale up. The limitation of adoption is current expensive mass spec which not everyone has. Built ADPL so it’s accessible for multiple labs.   2:27 PM: Jamie has a good understanding. 1-2 weeks to present it to the team at Millipore Sigma.   No further follow up questions.',\n",

Please share your latest portfolio of assets and we are actively looking to in-license.  Regarding the KEAP1/Nrf2 asset, we appreciate you giving us the opportunity to assess your technology. Unfortunately it is not a good fit at this time. Here is the feedback that I got from my team.   The inventors have deciphered a connection between glucose metabolism and the KEAP1/Nrf2 axis that can open the door for new strategies to target oxidative stress in a wide range diseases.  After giving it some thought, we have decided that the technology is a bit too early stage, given the stage of development of its competition, for Fannin to consider at this time. There are currently several pharmaceutical companies with Nrf2 activators in clinical trials (phases I - III). Some of these other Nrf2 activators are being tested for various indications including, pulmonary arterial hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and polycystic kidney disease. Based on the inventor’s publications and confidential slide deck, they have examined this technology for use in treatment of fibrotic lung disease and skin carcinogenesis. More data is needed to show that CBR-470 compounds are safe, efficacious and that they offer a clear advantage over competitors.  We have reservations about its efficacy for fibrotic lung disease, given that data from in vivo studies was limited – in terms of reduction in lung collagen deposition (early and later time points) and pulmonary function testing after treatment. Although reduced mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF was observed in vivo, assessments of key mediators involved in the fibrotic response are needed. In vivo measurements of other inflammatory cytokines, changes in levels of pro-fibrotic cytokines and changes in macrophage recruitment, numbers and phenotypes (pre- and post-treatment) in the bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue are needed to assess its efficacy for fibrotic lung disease. There are other widely-used animal models of fibrotic lung disease, that can be used to further test its efficacy. Also, more pharmacokinetic data is needed for each of the analogs in order to assess their safety.  We would be happy to hear about further developments on this technology, should its positioning (or the competitive landscape) substantially change, we would gladly re-evaluate. Thank you.

       " 'Dear Inventors,  This email is to inform you that Polsky Commercialization has determined that it will not file a patent application on this invention.   We reached out about a month ago to Argonne, and it, too, declined to patent.  After an initial review of the invention, we decided that industry feedback would be key for us on this one.   We marketed directly to Porometer, MTI Corp, Sterlitech, and MilliporeSigma (fka EMD Millipore, Millipore Corporation, Merck Millipore).  We had hopes for Millipore since we knew someone at the company had reviewed your publication, however, the company passed on the opportunity early on.  We were able to engage Sterlitech in discussions, but their ultimate response was this did not fit with their forward strategies.  Finally, we had some dialogue with Porometer, and some help from Rubin in identifying a few non-inventing professors we could reach out to as “market research”  to aid the company in its decision-making.   However, Porometer has gone silent.  Whether that is in response to their vision of market size or an effect of managing worklife during COVID-19, we can’t know.  This decision not to go forward is in no way a comment on the scientific merit or utility of the invention.  Our efforts strongly suggest that exclusive licensing was not a likely outcome, and non-exclusive strategies often do not make back the cost of patenting.  Thus, the business risk profile was not appropriate for us to fund.  However, as inventors closely tied to the technology, you may see things differently.  We can return the invention to you all, which would enable you to patent as owners if you so choose.  You would need to file a US application before the one year anniversary of the first publication of the invention, which we believe to be 6/22/2019.  Please know it is a long and expensive process, and it is best to give your attorney (should you choose to patent)  at least two months for drafting.

Chuan mentions psuedo-U sequencing that is improved on previous efforts out of the University of Utah. He wants to create a package deal since in the future it will be possible to combine all of the epigenetic sequencing methods.   Jamie asks what the advantage of Kas-Seq is. Chuan mentions that it is much easier and requires much less cells.   Jamie is interested in the CAP-C technology. This was sent in the original non-confidential information package. He requested more information.   Chuan mentions that he is working on enzymes that will mutate at the alkyl group and will not require the additional click chemistry step.

Issues with heat stability, issues with inertia to change process, first generation formulation was so successful so just wanted to fish. Discussed name recognition of Juan DePablo  What is the next step that needs to be flushed out as a proof of concept?

       " 'Morris calls Jake on 4/29:   Morris really likes the device and the approach. However, the manufacturers of N95 respirators recommend against using mercury light because of concerns of damaging the masks. As a company, there would be too much liability and potential lawsuit around openly violating manufacturers guidelines about sanitizing masks. Morris suggested googling \"technical bulletin N95 UVGI\" to see a citation that would describe this, and that it is not only anecdotal from his work in the space. He said that provided there was another light source such as UV-LED, that the company would be interested in aggressively perusing the technology.',\n",
       " 'This response from Xenex is interesting.     I just reviewed the literature on its and the conclusion is that pulsed UV lamps like the Xeon lamps that Xenex uses have the same germicidal effectiveness and low pressure mercury vapor (LPMV) lamps with the caveat being that Xeon lamps are broad spectrum and produce significantly more heat then LPMV.  Since the peak wavelength for rendering the RNA of a virus inactive is 260 to 265 nm and LPMV puts most of its power out in a single narrow band centered at 254 nm it avoids the possible damage of the mask material due to supper heating from the intense broad spectrum of the pulsed Xeon lamp.     I don\\'t understand what Morris was referring to in the statement:  \"current mask manufacturers recommend against the use of mercury light on their products because of issues with potential damage\".  We should possibly try to chase that down because in my mind a  photon of a particular wavelength is a photon independent of how it\\'s produced.     I looked at UV-LED as my first solution to solving the problem.  From an efficacy perspective, UV-LED\\'s are much higher than LPMV lamps - making them well suited for portable disinfection units such as something you would take on a backpacking trip to kill giardia in water it\\'s even more appealing since you may be able to power it with a small solar panel (an elegant wavelength converting device).  The problem with UV-LED\\'s that emit in the 260 nm wavelength is they are relatively new technology, are expensive, not readily available, and you would need to string together a few hundred of them - a manufacturing nightmare.  For what we are trying to do the LPMV lamp I believe is the best solution.     So getting back to Xenex - if you noticed on the company email graphic they have a green stamp that indicates \"No mercury\" that\\'s a good thing in general and possibly a good marketing feature - but I think that Xenex is competing with companies like Surfacide ( http://www.surfacide.com/ ) that use high powered 1.2 m long LPMV lamps to do the same room disinfection as the Xenex  Light Strike does.   We should reach out to Surfacide - they would have all the core manufacturing competencies that would be needed.  It\\'s unlikely that they would view this as competition for the full room Helios system, in fact, I think they would be happy to have the Helios systems back in use in rooms and used as intended and then offer a N95 mask unit as a complementary offering during a public health emergency.  I have a relationship with their engineer but he is relatively new to this roll in the company.  Gunner Lyslo is the Founder and CEO',\n",

There is a door, there would be an entrance cabinet in a more ironed out version (mini roll up garage door)  Current need PPE face shield and nitrile gloves, more plans to fix in the future and optimize  Same PPE for viral protection and operating the system   UVDI asks about applications: Peter mentions both helathcare and manufacturing as tracking the owner of the mask and return to the original owner. UVDI mentions that most hospitals are following the Nebreska protocol, Peter mentions he has his own protocol posted alongside this online.  Discussion around dosing changes and requirements and how they evolve overtime.   Peter discusses setup of masks on a rack using traditional UV room sterilization systems with radiation monitoring and how there is a lack of hitting the 3D areas   Norm asks about UVDI project: they mention modeling work on the mask, no work on the 3D shape, have been using radiometers at different angles.   Ashish from UVDI asks what the plan is: Norm mentions that they are interested in licensing the technology. In the short term the monetary aspect is less important than getting the solution out there. Longer term needs need to be solved in a non urgent way as well.

Goal is to make sure that the problem is solved in the short term and getting something out to the market and in the long term ways of partnering.  Norm asks if they want to review in more detail   UVDI solution is 2-3K masks per hour, Peter wants to understand the optimized angling more, efficacy and manufacturability with the FDA, even a small yield has to be build by someone reputable  Licensing the optimization of the angling, but still working on the final touches of the irradiance protection   Norm asks about manufacturing: UVDI does their own manufacturing   UVDI devices being validated with the Nebraska protocol, can offer assurance with recommended dose on the mask, but this is another turn key solution for someone that does not have the UVDI robot already and have the solution   Discussion about union protection and interest in the masks and the standards, etc.  Speculation that the emergency FDA clearance for emergency use would not be difficult, CDC has already put out guidance that the UV is a good solution  UVDI has the right answers to the questions at the right time regarding manufacturing, etc.  UVDI is overwhelmed, 200-1200% increase over normal, selective about projects, etc. and concerns over ability to do something in that area, audience and is important work, really novel, but unclear if there is the bandwhith to do so.

The design, process and procedures would need to be validated to ensure sterility – with a lot of other considerations put in place (e.g. mask material).  I do not recall any talk about consideration about particulate.  So whilst a mask previously used may be rendered sterile, it would still have environmental particulate on it (e.g. skin cells).

       " 'On Call: Werner Kaufmann (external innovation), Steve Hanley (product development and testing for plastic performance materials), Jinghang Wu (technical manager polyurathane systems), Sam Hutchinson (tech development), Eric Ginsburg, Stuart Rowan   Explained that some of the portfolio originated at Case Western University and background working with Allotera, initial funding and the material how to isolate CNCs with that  Explained working with Argonne on how to scale up to larger scale  Explained working with Allotera pulp making facility in Ohio and they are working on building going from pulp to CNCs   Interested to see if the process is cost effective, once got the response, the team was interested (preliminary cost effective analysis that was sent)  Clear that no confidentiality agreement in place   How does the cost compare to alternatives?  Stuart explains more of a technical advisor for allotera but he recommends talking to them and that he would put in touch but mentioned cost at about $15 per pound which is less than current charge for standard commercially available CNCs higher yielding and MXGs grow 6ft per year so it is an easier biosource to utilize which is responsible for cost savings   What is the difference between wood and MXGs?  The MXGs are slightly longer in crystal size which allows use of lower amounts lower loadings and better mechanical reinforcements   Allotera is building a facility to go large scale, one step is pulp making facility and other is large scale production  The scale up research has been done, just need to build the facility itself   Big challenge is homogenious distribution of the nanoparticle within the polymer and is possible   What is the decomposition temp? Depends on how you isolate the crystals and the acid conditions during the isolation. When you get the MXG cane treat with acid that dissolves cellulose and leaves crystalline cellulose   What type of solvent is being used? For some applications this is critical.  Depends on the polymer, ideally suspend nice in water, if polymer suspends in water can do anything in water. Dictated in water. For polyurathanes have done in emulsions, standard is in DMF usually or NMP things that are not scalable which is why working on better ways to do this. One of the biggest challenges for scaling up is how you process and use solvent. Can do this in latex, alot of work in oil and water latex and works well.   Negative charges on the nanoparticles which helps dispersion in water and polymer, prevents aggregation of the nanocrystals, so isolation method that gives the negative charge is important   Can the material be fully transparent? Yellow tint. What are the key criteria for this material to be added and what are the key features that would be improved?  Modulus of a single nanocrystal is 80GpA and data for MXGs goes up to 100GpA  Casting a neat film somewhere in the range of 10GpA  Optically transparent films, no yellowing or anything unless heat above 150 for sustained amount of time   Can think of them as uber cross-linkers   Polyurathanes make the most sense low loading and significant changes to material properties   CNCs ca hydrogen bond together very significant reenforcing network strong filler filler interactions   Charges on the CNCs allow them to be separated and isolated, partially sulfonated otherwise cannot sperate the material when isolating   Would the eclectic field help with dispersion? No, but can help with alignment   Hyderogen bond competing solvents allows for preperation without things precipitating out   Mice studies with injections are fine, inhalation may be a concern   How reactive are the hydroxy groups on the CNCs due to steric effects, can it react at RT or need elevated temp?  90 deg without a catalytst but lower temps with a cataylst, it depands on the OH and what position from the sugar but done different chemistry on the primary OHs all kinds of different chemistry   Send experimental samples of poyalls and help in dispersion and explore the application in polyurathane system or in GPU as a starting point and guidance from Werner on how to initiate collaboration and process and driving force through performance materials   Looking for big change in properties if they are going to be willing to engage   Action item next steps are to look at material transfer and collaboration agreement',\n",

Incubating and investing in companies. Will also do pre-seed for still in university, no company yet, may be ready with a little bit more money.  Criteria: seed is 0.5-1.5 million  For series A tap into the perceptive advisors venture fund which is the 4-5 billion crossover fund (many types of funding) known for later stage asset investments  Through this joint venture fund looking at the earlier stage companies which is a 210 million fund. Announced at the end of 2019. Therapeutics primarily, done some diagnostics and devices. Preference is for therapeutics. Any indication, any modality. Stage of development should have some level of animal proof of concept. In vivo and some IP filed. Companies do not have to go to Boston, tech can live at chicago. Work virtually to give money and also collaborate and bring on the network and the team. Design the preclinical program.   Can go stepwise seed to series A or sometimes directly to series A   Brittany asks sometimes techs pondering the startup and so she asks what type of level of involvement the investigator has and if not heavily involved how can team be put together?  Do not PIs to leave the day job, PI founder and advisor and continue to be engaged but they can take over the rest of it.  Just the academic founder. Sometimes part time executive with some time in company. But not fully built out team, they bring the team and will drive the program forward. Do not want spend all the money into salary, keep virtual and farm to CRO and be efficient about it.

IP is an issued patent in the US and that one is closed methods of treatment IRES inhibitor. Newer family of the IP that describes inhibitors in broader terms. Heather will send the issued patent and the pending patent information as well. The question asked is: variability in terms of the symptoms and whether he has addressed that. Help him develop the assay to guide and monitor therapy.  Is the PI someone who is easy to work with? Yes What is the form of the deck or further data? No deck, would have to be put together. He put together a description of the current state of his lab that is 1.5 years old.  Is he interested in creating a company? Wants the work to get into people corp partnership, sees himself as helping to make sure his baby is in good hands.  Anything beyond SCA? Various forms but that is the main focus.

Karen develops neural stem cell line for clinical applications, approved by the FDA, stem cell line can be systemically injected or direct to brain and cross and goes to other side, kind of like a vehicle, tends to go to areas of injury, stroke, cancer  Combine the virus and load this onto the stem cell line to allow the potential to overcome viral spread and replication barriers to limit pre-existing immunity to lentiviral vectors  AAV that has modification to bind receptors expressed on tumors, created virus, loaded onto neuronal stem cells, 10+ years preclinical  FDA 4 years ago IND for first in human clinical trial using delivery of neural stem cells  Receptor mediated update PK7 modification that binds to heprin sulfate proteo-glycans on tumor surface, highly expressed in tumors (transfection)  Transcriptional modification is the survivan   Where is the mfg being done and how much is available right now?  Mfg was done under a grant collaborative and cross institution all academic and produced enough for phase i clinical trial completed  Phase II is planed but need to produce and manufacture 90 days  In the stages of planning the phase II study  Phase I trial completed novel delivery of virus and was also the first time that could do upfront, not recurrent and then get standard of care radiation with chemo and there is a radio-induced promoter so may replicate better  Finished phase I 3 moths ago with no tox observed at highest dose   Has Roger on his team that can deploy large trial at 300 sites around the world  Need to decide if want repeat dosing or not   Cameron asks about the phase I learning: had 3 doses and the highest cohort never showed toxicity, the limitation is the volume of injection to the brain and the number of cells that can be produced  The protocol was single administration not repeat  Did subsequent radiation induce the promoter? Or outside the scope?  Would have to go back and do biopsies, limited with IRB guidelines can't do for everyone, but went to do resection and did have a few examples with clean histology and just necrotic tissue, patients that responded, manuscript is being prepared right now, some emerging data about the biology even though just phase I data   Versatility and addressable market of the technology?  Neurotropic because of the neural stem cells, the other caveat is that the FDA allowed upfront usage but extended from glioblastoma from most aggressive to also less aggressive tumors-->rare indication expansion  No one has completed a phase I study with stem cell delivery yet and also have a way to track and image   Need to raise some money to run a phase II clinical trial and Cameron mentions that this is at the lower end of what he does, the amount of money needed to be raised for the trial is within range of what he does  There is not a legal entity housing the IP separate, Karen had an entity that had an option but the company dissolved and that has expired   Cameron mentions an IIA with one leading the charge?  Thelma mentions for the IP this is true, and University of Chicago would be the one who is negotiated  The additional work is owned by Northwestern and improvements would be handled by NU and they also have the clinical package for the phase I and IND filings   Cameron contemplates straight forward to set up Delware C4 and then work on exclusive worldwide license and talk about milestones and terms  Cameron's model seems to work with the UChicago model for licensing and that this should be standard and an SRA to fund the clinical trials and Cameron gets the Bayh Doel restrictions   Emphasize being fair to the founders to avoid sperate investors and inventors in different classes  Mindful of dilution   Only potential issue that is slight nervous is how do you mitigate a serious event in phase II and wants to talk about a pipeline of new techs in preclinical around the platform to make investors feel a little better (new tech or new application) so that  the tech does not collapse with one adverse event in phase II to make his investors less cautious is worried about a serious adverse event in phase II if the company is public   Can even be a preclinical asset to assure people that this is not the end of the road   Lesniak mentions other applications: intranasal delivery for pediatric brain tumors (no treatment) the underlying technology is very robust and certainly other applications to mitigate the risk  What Cameron wants to do is raise different rounds for the preclinical work and the clinical trial   Cameron wants to go under NDA to see everything that they have and NU would have to be under the scope of this to talk about the clinical trial results  Cameron needs to get comfortable with the phase I for due dilligence to understand the protocol and the grounds for well tolerated  People not looking for efficacy but wants to look annecdotal for ways to get a handle on this\",\n",

Start out with facilitation of specific questions:  What work has been completed beyond what they saw with the Staph infection models? What is the development status? Published work.  Model of infection and colonization (different mouse models) want to use fresh human blood because mouse does not show all activities the infection can exploit to stay alive such as coagulation, have not really developed any new models, focusing at the moment on trying to see the antibody effector function and the mechanism of this effector function.   With regards to the function, how are the MOA studies progressing?  It is not clear how the bacteria gets killed, hard to find correlates of protection.   Have antibodies against coagulase, looking to find synergies and have bi-functional antibodies   Any work to improve affinity for the antigen?  Not yet, prefer to use human and not humanized antibodies in industry. So that means would have to repeat and go back to isolation of the antibodies since would have to go synthetic to further improve affinity.   No data to show compliment, difficult to show because of the challenging surface of the bacteria   No killing in Serum, is all due to the effector function   Also working on modification of protein that does not bind in order to produce immunity   Based on antibody results does that mean that developing a vaccine will be difficult? Developing a vaccine against the same bacteria, will that be difficult because of some of the findings shown by the antibody?  Also working on the vaccine, vaccine also targets protein A and mentioned some of the vaccine efforts occurring to date  Advantage of using their antibody is the fact that it targets protein A specifically   Neil asks about the compliment killing and wants to ask how that is actually working?  Dom says that she does not know yet and is trying to develop assays for this.  She suspects there is compliment killing but they are not positive about it.  The distinction she is making is that to kill Staph you need an immune cell, if simply have compliments it won't kill. If you have an antibody that binds a gram - bacteria you would get killing.   Dom will be able to provide clarification in the next few weeks, Brittany will facilitate with providing the information as it becomes available.   For Virtici to try to understand where they are at, if the paper is accepted that would help them to look at strategies to optimize the antibody and move this along.   Beyond publication, any other data under a CDA? Dom says yes, but she wants to know what they will do with the antibody.  Dom wants to share publication when it is out with Brittany and then resume the discussion under CDA if there is interest.  Heidi asks if there is any information they can provide to help with the process. After publication, would want a summary of what is available under CDA.

I wish you all the best for your new opportunity, it was a pleasure working with you.  With regards to Chuan He’s technology, we focused our discussion on the method to detect RNA modifications.  I had one discussion with Heather on this technology where I addressed some question but I never got a response. These questions/discussion points would have been important for the path forward in developing an assay.   • In the existing for the RNA-sac kit would be an expensive kit as it would require three different enzymes (MjDim, Bst2.0 and FTO). Chuan He mentioned an improved version that would reduce this number. • In addition he mentioned that he is working on a new version that contains a different but well known  RT enzyme. An enzyme that had been used for other purposes and would overcome the need of the control reaction. That would be important due to the costs and of course lower the amount of input material.  • The last aspect was the use of Iodine: I am not sure that we would be allowed to ship this reagent with a potential kit. And apart from epigeneticists with strong chemical background, I am not sure if this reagent is available in many more biological related labs. It would be nice to receive your feedback in this direction.  Following he discussion we had internal discussions on HiC alternatives and discussed the CAPC-Seq approach. At the moment, we do not believe that this method is something that we would like to commercialize. One reason is that we believe, that this method still would fall under the original HiC  IP, which had been licensed co-exclusive to three companies. Not questioning the novelty, but it still covers some of the main claims of the “original” IP.  The main interest still would be the Kat-seq approach, but during the original meeting he mentioned the interest to develop the method further and commercialize through his own company. I do not know if these plans changed or if there is any other opportunity to cooperate on this method.

Scientifically the project is well writing with interesting data, however we identified three points appearing like “no-go flag” for us in our scouting process: • First, we compared the preclinical data on EAE models available in the patent with our respective preclinical data about a similar project for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and we obtained better preventive and symptomatic effects regarding the delay of the onset of symptoms and the management of relapses.  • Secondly, the effective dose (8mg/kg) seems to be the current approved dose of Guanabenz in the treatment of hypertension without a dose effect potential, bringing two problematics for the commercialization: o How to avoid co-prescription? Here, the use of reduced dose seems less effective, and a potential combination with interferon will be required to prove a synergistic effect. o How to manage potential adverse effects related to the use of an antihypertensive drug?   Nevertheless, we keep a strong interest in the University and the Grossman Institute projects, and I hope we could keep in touch in the future about others potential opportunities of collaboration.

They are a genetics based company, so are most interested  Awad talks about bi-allelic mutations with autosomal domanance inheritance, but even in the sporadic form of the disease, those are also due to somatic mutations of the same disease  Restore gene function in endothelium, question is will the lesion digress if the lesion is already formed (but not for the genetic form)   The normal goal of UG is to target neurons and not endothelium, maybe easier to target endithelium because no blood brain barrier  Mentioned Duke collaboration viral vectors for the endothelium   Asked to explain more about the CCM biology and how it is related to the immune inflammatory response?  Breakdown of BBB and exposure of neuroglial cells and dead and dying enothelium that expose the cytoskelaton to autoimmune response full of B Cells and compliment T Cells  B Cell depletion approach can blunt lesion progression, clinically relelvant aspect  Rapamycin TOR activation and CCM activity-mechanistic on the effect of the mutation, anti T cell effect   Asked why this may not be reversible?

       " 'Hi David,    On the call with Dr. Grossman, he was going through the data commons he wants to work with Microsoft, but he is very busy with the prior commitment.  Hence, his data commons framework he developed in AWS will be re-written in Azure by the Rush University. He spoke to Rush, and they have agreed to work on this. Hence, he will be working directly with the Rush to help them on the architecture side of it.       Rush and Microsoft on partnership will be developing the data commons in Azure, which will be open-source.  So Dr. Grossman, directly not working with Microsoft in this project, but working via Rush.

I want to acknowledge that there is a lot of information in there, so we're doing some work on our end to help identify the people most relevant to our research.    I've also been pushing along some internal discussions in the last week, and there are a couple areas we would like to continue exploring in particular.    Preeti mentioned a startup accelerator focused on quantum software and hardware; we would like to have a dedicated discussion to learn more about the effort. We would be happy to discuss ways in which we could contribute our time and our experience to help guide participants and grow the quantum ecosystem. This is something our executive team has much experience doing and greatly enjoys.    As I mentioned, our researchers have also identified a number of faculty who we would love to get to know. We're still putting together the list, so I will reach out next week with the names along with our ideas for what we would like to discuss to help you start that conversation.

Budget constraints made this project, which is very early, hard to prioritize among some more 'target-ready' proposals. That being said, we do encourage continued engagement.

       " 'David, Omkar,    I hope you are well!   Please forgive my slow response in returning feedback to you. Our goal on the asset acquisition team is to act as the internal champion for these research proposals, and that means trying to garner approval from many different individuals on senior management. So sometimes it can take time to get everyone in the same room (or Zoom meeting) together.    We were all super impressed with the science being advanced at U Chicago. Right at this time we could not come up with tractable development plans that play to our internal strengths at BridgeBio. Since we wouldn’t be the right partner to translate these scientific approaches to patients, we aren’t in a good position to provide funding. For now we are going to stay on the sidelines and hopefully stay in touch with the investigators. We are happy to help in other ways – by providing more granular feedback about ways to position their research for translation, or perhaps trying to introduce them to others who can help.    There are more details in the feedback document, but for your info, I summarized the logic behind our decisions below. The science is stellar with each and every one of these, and I am just highlighting the business/strategic reason below for you.   Dr. Dawson – He is advancing an unconventional treatment modality (quantum dots with cell-permeable peptides) that we don’t have R&D experience in Dr. Moskowitz – His research is too early for translational support because he is still looking for new ways to treat congenital heart disease (as soon as he might find a way then we are excited to re-engage) Dr. Roos – He is targeting a protein that is not mutated or genetically altered, which is out of scope for us given we generally only support therapeutic development that aims to directly target the underlying genetics in disease Dr. Awad – There are too many mTOR inhibitors already in development for us to believe we might have a competitive advantage (or IP space to work with) in developing another one    I hope the investigators find the feedback helpful – our goal is to provide more than just a yes/no answer, but to really be transparent about why we are not the best partners, and what data or experiments might change how we view the approach with regard to our pipeline and strategic interests. I remain encouraged that if we are able to repeat this process next year we may be in a better position to help.   Let me know if you or the investigators wish to speak over the phone.

While the scientific advancement is an impressive one, we feel that the technology is too early stage for our platform. Additionally, several of the market opportunities our research identified as having strong commercialization potential are outside of Professor Park’s main research focus. We are interesting in keeping in contact around this technology, especially as new work is done on electrical, optical, and optoelectronic properties of nanostructures, although we believe that there is additional early stage research and validation that would be needed prior to the technology being ready for our platform. I’ve attached our final summary report.    Please let me know if you have any questions. Also, we’d be happy to connect with Professor Park if he is interested in a conversation around potential market applications.    As a quick update on the super-resolution imaging technology and our review process, we are still talking with people in various industries regarding a range potential applications. We have not identified a market that would be large enough to support commercialization of the technology yet, although there are several more industry experts we are connecting with, and we are hoping to find a market that could support the technology.

In summary, we were of course really impressed by the relevance and the depth of expertise and extremely thankful for your coordination and the time spent by the faculty with us.   Below is our current thinking and the next steps we plan:   So far we have done the following sessions: 1.Prof Chen – Nanomaterials to sense different materials in liquid, e.g. water… As my team, we need to assess “Water” opportunity and if we think it is a market we can go after, we would like to circle back to Prof Chen. If Prof Chen thinks that there other applications of his technology in gas sensing or other application spaces, he can certainly let us know and we would be happy to reconnect. So the ball is in our court (few months of effort on our side) unless we hear otherwise. 2.Prof Tay – Covid-19 based on Saliva, Sepsis, Microbiome… We thought that there could be of an immediate interest here. We are working on a project which may pivot and become really relevant to Prof Tay's research area… We may come back to you in weeks to see if and what we can do. 3.Prof Maurer – Quantum Sensing with potential Gas Sensing apps.. We thought that this was big game-changer. But we could not tell if it is ready for application in the next year or so if we were able to id an application. I personally would be happy to follow up with Prof Maurer to assess that angle. If it is really the case we can do something in the near future with 10x benefits to the next best alternative, we can certainly explore further.   Hope the comments above make sense.  Should you have any questions, pls let us know. I am happy to chat as well, if better.   If we do not connect, happy Thanksgiving to you and your loved ones.

This  platform can be quickly repurposed to target any new gene for any indication/TA, as long as gene is hepatically expressed, so the idea really would be to collaborate with research groups with novel therapeutic genes/MoAs that could be addressed with our platform.  TAs where we might be more likely to identify hepatocyte genes with a role in disease are Hepatology (NASH, fatty liver, cholestasis, bile acid disorders etc) but also cardiovascular disease/lipid disorders.

Vikram and Supratik are identifying relevant AIFARMS faculty members to attend the three separate deep-dive meetings we discussed.      Could you please provide a Honeywell attendee list for each topic?  I can run point on scheduling on our side.  Looking forward to furthering these discussions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.   Project 1: Wireless Underground Sensor Network (WUSN) based IoT for agriculture and environmental Summary: Over the past few years we have been developing scalable, working buried wireless sensor networks using fully buried, ruggedized sensor boxes, along with a low power wireless IoT system such as Lora and Sigfox.  The system includes data collected every 30 mins and curated and visualizable in near real time at Thoreau.uchicago.edu.  The sensor box technology includes the sensors (soil moisture, pH, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil), microprocessor, radio and antenna, power supply and moisture sealing.  Currently we have a 23 node WUSN operating for ~ 1 year at a working farm in the Chicagoland area.  We also have research undergoing on building sensing devices for dissolved nitrates—there currently are no good in-situ nitrate sensors available today as products.     Project 2: Computer Vision with Applications to Livestock Monitoring Summary: Computer Vision (CV) is a particularly important technology for digital agriculture. Several AIFARMS projects are driving research in techniques and applications for CV, such as 24x7 monitoring of livestock health and behavior, video-driven high-throughput phenotyping for plant biology and crop sciences, video-based disease and pest detection in crops, and video-guided manipulation of objects for automated harvesting.  AIFARMS aims to make progress in both novel uses of AI technologies (such as CV) and in foundational AI challenges that can make these far much more effective.  Key AI research challenges in CV that we are tackling include occlusion, individual animal identification and tracking (which can be much harder in some livestock species than in humans), pose estimation, behavior prediction, and 3D reconstruction.   Project 3: IoT and Edge Computing Summary: Because of the pervasive and diverse uses of sensors in agriculture, IoT and edge computing are essential technologies.  Our vision for a farm of the future is a highly networked and sensor-rich operation enabled by an extensive, low-cost IoT system that monitors and manages most or all production activities.  Key technologies we are exploring include mobile and fixed camera networks, environmental and biochemical sensors, distributed heterogeneous computing, federated learning, and edge computing  (including edge machine learning).
