Being an LIS company, Digital Pathology for us means the ability to access whole slide scans remotely.

Jacob Lissoos,Jacob Lissoos,2019-08-20,"Hi Hina,  Thank you for looking this over. All good questions.   What are current diagnostic practices that it could be used in place of? The idea is that it can replace single cell RNA sequencing to identify maladaptive cellular interactions and populations of inflammatory cells. Specific information on cellular architecture and the organization of inflammatory cellular networks can be identified with the invention but is lost with current methods.    Which autoimmune disorders does it diagnose? In a combination of mouse models and retrospective clinical biopsies, the technology was tested on lupus. It is hypothesized that it could also be applied to evaluating cancer patient sensitivity to chemotherapy as a companion diagnostic.   What kind of tissue samples does this work with? This would depend on the disease being diagnosed. For the proof of concept with lupus, they used renal biopsy samples.    Does that help answer your questions? I hope it does!

Jacob Lissoos,Jacob Lissoos,2019-10-08,"Hi Melda,  There are no proteomic or genetic biomarkers. The technology works by analyzing T Cell shape and size to determine if there are cognate interactions occurring with neighboring antigen presenting cells, and uses this data as the basis of the diagnosis. There would still be the need for the kidney biopsy sample, the main advantage is the high throughout way in which the samples can be analyzed compared to manual analysis. There is extensive in vivo proof of concept data right now using mouse models of Lupus.   Right now the current standard is manual analysis of stained confocal microscopy samples by a pathologist, so this is a tool that can be used to speed throughput.   If you are more interested in biomarkers that would eliminate the need for the invasive kidney biopsy sample as a companion diagnostic, this is very useful feedback that we can relay to the inventors.

In the meantime I can provide some more detailed context.  Our model is essentially one of a freelance EIR - we read over technologies, discuss them internally, and do some further research by contacting tech managers, inventors, and potential customers.  If there's enough interest on all sides, we form a company in which we own an equity stake (but usually not a majority) and start doing fundraising using a variety of methods, including federal (i-Corps, SBIR/STTRs, etc - we've done three i-Corps and had 2 successful STTRs), private grants (usually state based - we've raised over $100k from them in various states) and private financing (Raised over $1m from a variety of angel and VC investors).  We then help the business on a project management / business development side and work closely with someone with technical expertise to move the technology toward the milestones necessary to become a commercial product.  We bring on a significant network of lawyers, accountants, FDA consultants, industrial designers, funding sources and others that are necessary to help move products to market.  We don't pay ourselves until we have either raised some money from a financing round or a federal/state grant, and our interests are completely aligned with the company as we own equity in it.  We then help the company grow as quickly as we can.  I hope all of that makes sense.  I'll be traveling Friday but should be generally available for the rest of the week and into next week.

Jacob Lissoos,Jacob Lissoos,2019-10-24,"Final feedback is to keep in touch as development of the assets progresses:   Respiratory Small Molecules 17-T-120: We were initially intrigued in looking at this technology in the context of respiratory diseases but the feedback was that we wanted something more akin to prevention of the disease state before the fibrosis happens and that a therapeutic is less attractive. What we are wondering is if there is any application of this approach for other chronic fibrotic type of conditions such as chronic kidney disease/fibrosis.  Is there any in vitro or in vivo experiment that may speak to relevance in reversing chronic kidney disease? If so a small experiment showing positive effects would make this interested in pursuing further.   Vaccines 15-T-04: I did my thesis research on polymer adjuvants for vaccines so this one hit close to home.  The mouse data seems intriguing but we would need to see some more data that indicates that this system might lead to an extended protective immunity or beneficial aspects of stabilizing antigens or formulation. More relevant pathogens to us that could be of interest would be Eimeria, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, or in combination with modified live virus vaccines as potential studies that would lead to more interest from us as well as potentially move forward a human health focused research program.  Parasiticide (MRSA) Small Molecule 12-T-059: Good early MIC data but we would like to see the translation into some in vivo experiments showing efficacy in alleviating disease from Staph.   Parasiticide (SSTI) Small Molecule 10-T-108: Similar response as above but maybe continued work in refining to obtain a better in vivo survival response before we would be ready to engage.   Parasiticide (Sepsis) Small Molecules 16-T-097: This one is intriguing as there may be application in allergy in dogs and cats which is a rapidly expanding market.

As the Director of Technical Operations and Head of Portfolio Strategy and Development, I am responsible for identifying strategic investment opportunities for BioMotiv.  We are interested in engaging with institutions with strong life science and/or medicinal chemistry research programs to determine if there may be a fit between our organizations.  BioMotiv is the mission-driven development company associated with The Harrington Project for Discovery & Development, a national initiative centered at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Biomotiv’s mission is to accelerate breakthrough discoveries from research institutions into therapeutics for patients. Using our extensive deep drug development experience, we license technologies and form single-asset companies to develop innovative small molecules or biologics into medicines.  Based on our unique business model, we have secured investment from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Biogen, Takeda, Charles River Laboratories, and Arix BioScience to pioneer medical innovations in a variety of areas. Recently, BioMotiv and Bristol-Myers Squibb announced a strategic partnership, under which we will form and fund new companies to develop novel therapeutics for disease areas with unmet medical need.   As part of our efforts to identify opportunities that align with our strategy, we are sending out a request for proposals (RFP) for projects in our areas of interest, which include oncology, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and fibrosis.  We plan on attending JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco from Jan 13-16 and, if possible, would like to use that opportunity to introduce our company and to discuss licensing opportunities that may align with our portfolio.

While this is very good science and an impressive publication we will pass on this one because: - The competitive field for NRF2 seems to be very busy and we don’t have sufficient expertise to be bullish with this technology facing the large amount of assets in development: http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/70/2/348 - The technology lacks direct data indicating stem cell activation component and while historical data linking NRF2 to the stem cell biology are in place that would have to be directly shown with the given NCE - The stem cell activation would have to be demonstrated as an MOA in the specific animal model the group is aiming to pursue (eg IPF) + FDA approved treatment as a positive control. - This technology would require very strong in vivo animal models demonstrating its superiority over the SOC and other NRF2 targeting drugs approved/in development.  I hope that this feedback will be somewhat helpful to prof. Moellering. I would be happy to review other late stage technologies if you know of any. I will also review the portfolio posted on your website. I wish Happy Holidays to you and your colleagues at Polsky Center!

Please find detail on how the algorithms can be shared with us without disclosing the IP for evaluation:  ""Nuevozen software platform allows seamless integration of AI/ML algorithms/models from partner institutions through well-defined API calls without the need to share the algorithm code details or models. These algorithms can be hosted in a Virtual Machine or a docker container which exposes the API as a microservice through HTTP protocol (within the server cluster or hospital/diagnostic center network infrastructure). Nuevozen has standard API definitions for exchanging images & data, invoking AI algorithms & models, visualizing results in a unified GUI that can be securely accessed by the Radiologists and Physicians. The software tracks the usage of these APIs, number of times the models were invoked, version history etc.  Docker image can be distributed using either of the two options.   - Creation of a private repository in Docker Hub or Amazon EC 2 container Registry - Save the image to a tar archive using “docker save” command and shared with Nuevozen.  Likewise the Image of Virtual machine can be shared in the form of file(s) through cloud storage or USB drive.”  Let me know if you have any updates on testing algorithm at UC. I am really hoping we can move this forward quickly.  Best Regards,",Neutral,Positive,0.0721106007695198,0.007872764021158218,0.9200166463851929

For the M6A profiling assay: 1) Can this method profile other RNA modifications in parallel, or would separate libraries be made for M6A and M1A profiles? 2) Under applications, ‘Whole genome epigenetic profiling’ is listed. Does this method profile genomic information, such as lncRNAs bound to DNA? Or is it restricted to transcriptomic information (mRNA, tRNA, unbound lncRNA) 3) The method was validated with a low-throughput method for m6a screening. What was that method, and how correlated were results?  For the directed evolution of RT enzymes assay: 1) Is this an NGS-based assay?

Jacob Lissoos,Jacob Lissoos,2020-01-30,"2:05 PM Jamie introduced himself after Ray joined. Talked about kits, research tools, that Millipore has licensed. Interest from PNAS paper and perhaps expand on Duolink. Interested in hearing the technology from Ray’s own words.  2:07 PM Ray: Nature Communications paper was the earlier paper to progression to the PNAS paper. In ‘omics space there is a need for higher resolution. Chemical probes were developed to understand protein function. They were nice from a purely discovery view – low input low resolution. Ray was interested in single cell single state resolution without a new probe every time without a new chemical entity every time. Integrate oligonucleotide barcodes and chemical functionality approach to image single activity each time. Move away from Duolink’s approach with multiple antibodies to make modular. Imaging was described in Nature Comms but PNAS showed small samples. Use proximity approach to get signal. Barcode multiplex in full solution. This approach can do target ID and quantify, monitor multiple things in a sample. High throughput phenotyping application. Readout can be qPCR, sequencing, digital droplet, etc. Where we’re going? The sensitivity can be done in single cell solution base, like CTCs or joining it with microfluidics. Enzyme activity pathology – rather than staining for one target, we can look at the activity of many enzymes. Probes are modular so we can target other protein families. Looking at clinical diagnostics.   2:14 PM Jamie: Single cell – how high of a plex can you go?   2:15 PM Ray:  we haven’t hit the ceiling yet. See PNAS paper. Since it’s targeting families, it can look within and between families of proteins.  2:16 PM Jamie: any competing technology besides Duolink?  2:16 PM Ray: The closest thing looking at abundance of proteins other than Duolink, there’s really nothing in the activity space. One of the limitations of dual antibody PLA is that you need at least two antibodies and it needs two epitopes. If you are only interested in the abundance in the protein, ADPL has greater success because we only need one good antibody. The probe gets the active site the antibody gets the other. Other than Duolink I don’t think there’s anything else out there.   2:20 PM Jamie asked about IP; SN to send Jamie the PCT.  Ray: we design the system with probes that already exist. Mostly activity is looking at lysate which has problems. Probes need to traverse the cell membrane which ours can or developed so they have the properties. The modular pieces will fit into our system. Other groups are looking with probes using ADPLs. Making other handles like biotin. Some probes can work that are already out there, but our probes can be a one size fit all for certain families. New probes being developed  2:23 PM: Jamie: How many probes have been made?  2:23 PM Ray: We’ve used probes that we know the profile. We’ve benchmarked on known probes. These probes don’t have to be activity dependent as long as it’s something that recognizes the target of interest.  2:25 PM Jamie: you don’t really have to really fine-tune. Is it turnkey?  2:25 PM Ray: It’s pretty turnkey. Clinicians say activity is pretty important. Chemical probes are easy to scale up. The limitation of adoption is current expensive mass spec which not everyone has. Built ADPL so it’s accessible for multiple labs.   2:27 PM: Jamie has a good understanding. 1-2 weeks to present it to the team at Millipore Sigma.

We have expanded our team and hope the process will be faster in the future. Please share your latest portfolio of assets and we are actively looking to in-license.  Regarding the KEAP1/Nrf2 asset, we appreciate you giving us the opportunity to assess your technology. Unfortunately it is not a good fit at this time. Here is the feedback that I got from my team.   The inventors have deciphered a connection between glucose metabolism and the KEAP1/Nrf2 axis that can open the door for new strategies to target oxidative stress in a wide range diseases.  After giving it some thought, we have decided that the technology is a bit too early stage, given the stage of development of its competition, for Fannin to consider at this time. There are currently several pharmaceutical companies with Nrf2 activators in clinical trials (phases I - III). Some of these other Nrf2 activators are being tested for various indications including, pulmonary arterial hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and polycystic kidney disease. Based on the inventor’s publications and confidential slide deck, they have examined this technology for use in treatment of fibrotic lung disease and skin carcinogenesis. More data is needed to show that CBR-470 compounds are safe, efficacious and that they offer a clear advantage over competitors.  We have reservations about its efficacy for fibrotic lung disease, given that data from in vivo studies was limited – in terms of reduction in lung collagen deposition (early and later time points) and pulmonary function testing after treatment. Although reduced mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF was observed in vivo, assessments of key mediators involved in the fibrotic response are needed. In vivo measurements of other inflammatory cytokines, changes in levels of pro-fibrotic cytokines and changes in macrophage recruitment, numbers and phenotypes (pre- and post-treatment) in the bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue are needed to assess its efficacy for fibrotic lung disease. There are other widely-used animal models of fibrotic lung disease, that can be used to further test its efficacy. Also, more pharmacokinetic data is needed for each of the analogs in order to assess their safety.  We would be happy to hear about further developments on this technology, should its positioning (or the competitive landscape) substantially change, we would gladly re-evaluate. Thank you.

We marketed directly to Porometer, MTI Corp, Sterlitech, and MilliporeSigma (fka EMD Millipore, Millipore Corporation, Merck Millipore).  We had hopes for Millipore since we knew someone at the company had reviewed your publication, however, the company passed on the opportunity early on.  We were able to engage Sterlitech in discussions, but their ultimate response was this did not fit with their forward strategies.  Finally, we had some dialogue with Porometer, and some help from Rubin in identifying a few non-inventing professors we could reach out to as “market research”  to aid the company in its decision-making.   However, Porometer has gone silent.  Whether that is in response to their vision of market size or an effect of managing worklife during COVID-19, we can’t know.  This decision not to go forward is in no way a comment on the scientific merit or utility of the invention.  Our efforts strongly suggest that exclusive licensing was not a likely outcome, and non-exclusive strategies often do not make back the cost of patenting.  Thus, the business risk profile was not appropriate for us to fund.  However, as inventors closely tied to the technology, you may see things differently.  We can return the invention to you all, which would enable you to patent as owners if you so choose.  You would need to file a US application before the one year anniversary of the first publication of the invention, which we believe to be 6/22/2019.  Please know it is a long and expensive process, and it is best to give your attorney (should you choose to patent)  at least two months for drafting.     Please let us know you would like the invention returned to you.  Preeti and I are happy to discuss how that would work should it be of interest.

Michael Hinton,Jacob Lissoos,2020-04-29,"This response from Xenex is interesting.     I just reviewed the literature on its and the conclusion is that pulsed UV lamps like the Xeon lamps that Xenex uses have the same germicidal effectiveness and low pressure mercury vapor (LPMV) lamps with the caveat being that Xeon lamps are broad spectrum and produce significantly more heat then LPMV.  Since the peak wavelength for rendering the RNA of a virus inactive is 260 to 265 nm and LPMV puts most of its power out in a single narrow band centered at 254 nm it avoids the possible damage of the mask material due to supper heating from the intense broad spectrum of the pulsed Xeon lamp.     I don't understand what Morris was referring to in the statement:  ""current mask manufacturers recommend against the use of mercury light on their products because of issues with potential damage"".  We should possibly try to chase that down because in my mind a  photon of a particular wavelength is a photon independent of how it's produced.     I looked at UV-LED as my first solution to solving the problem.  From an efficacy perspective, UV-LED's are much higher than LPMV lamps - making them well suited for portable disinfection units such as something you would take on a backpacking trip to kill giardia in water it's even more appealing since you may be able to power it with a small solar panel (an elegant wavelength converting device).  The problem with UV-LED's that emit in the 260 nm wavelength is they are relatively new technology, are expensive, not readily available, and you would need to string together a few hundred of them - a manufacturing nightmare.  For what we are trying to do the LPMV lamp I believe is the best solution.     So getting back to Xenex - if you noticed on the company email graphic they have a green stamp that indicates ""No mercury"" that's a good thing in general and possibly a good marketing feature - but I think that Xenex is competing with companies like Surfacide ( http://www.surfacide.com/ ) that use high powered 1.2 m long LPMV lamps to do the same room disinfection as the Xenex  Light Strike does.   We should reach out to Surfacide - they would have all the core manufacturing competencies that would be needed.  It's unlikely that they would view this as competition for the full room Helios system, in fact, I think they would be happy to have the Helios systems back in use in rooms and used as intended and then offer a N95 mask unit as a complementary offering during a public health emergency.  I have a relationship with their engineer but he is relatively new to this roll in the company.

There is a door, there would be an entrance cabinet in a more ironed out version (mini roll up garage door)  Current need PPE face shield and nitrile gloves, more plans to fix in the future and optimize  Same PPE for viral protection and operating the system   UVDI asks about applications: Peter mentions both helathcare and manufacturing as tracking the owner of the mask and return to the original owner. UVDI mentions that most hospitals are following the Nebreska protocol, Peter mentions he has his own protocol posted alongside this online.  Discussion around dosing changes and requirements and how they evolve overtime.   Peter discusses setup of masks on a rack using traditional UV room sterilization systems with radiation monitoring and how there is a lack of hitting the 3D areas   Norm asks about UVDI project: they mention modeling work on the mask, no work on the 3D shape, have been using radiometers at different angles.   Ashish from UVDI asks what the plan is: Norm mentions that they are interested in licensing the technology. In the short term the monetary aspect is less important than getting the solution out there. Longer term needs need to be solved in a non urgent way as well.   Ashish asks about looking for a manufacturing partner. Norm mentions no experience with working through the process of going through FDA approval and provide guidance, take the process on themselves.  Concern over many solutions out there, portable devices and rack setup, fixtures and systems around those, but not as a conveyor system (mentions the RPI system)   Discussion of RPI system and how that came out  Norm tries to clarify what the interest from the UVDI team would be. Goal is to make sure that the problem is solved in the short term and getting something out to the market and in the long term ways of partnering.  Norm asks if they want to review in more detail   UVDI solution is 2-3K masks per hour, Peter wants to understand the optimized angling more, efficacy and manufacturability with the FDA, even a small yield has to be build by someone reputable  Licensing the optimization of the angling, but still working on the final touches of the irradiance protection   Norm asks about manufacturing: UVDI does their own manufacturing   UVDI devices being validated with the Nebraska protocol, can offer assurance with recommended dose on the mask, but this is another turn key solution for someone that does not have the UVDI robot already and have the solution   Discussion about union protection and interest in the masks and the standards, etc.  Speculation that the emergency FDA clearance for emergency use would not be difficult, CDC has already put out guidance that the UV is a good solution  UVDI has the right answers to the questions at the right time regarding manufacturing, etc.  UVDI is overwhelmed, 200-1200% increase over normal, selective about projects, etc. and concerns over ability to do something in that area, audience and is important work, really novel, but unclear if there is the bandwhith to do so.   UVDI mentions no manufacturing, maybe take it to market, and use a contract manufacturer, Norm mentions they would want some advice on what organizations to use   Eric asks about suggestions of who to talk to from a manufacturing perspective: NC FDA consultant that does work with UVDI   Follow up action items:  Review internally and get back if have the bandwidth to take the project on and what collaboration structure could be best and mutually beneficial",Neutral,Positive,0.03717115893959999,0.019275343045592308,0.9435535669326782

The design, process and procedures would need to be validated to ensure sterility – with a lot of other considerations put in place (e.g. mask material).  I do not recall any talk about consideration about particulate.  So whilst a mask previously used may be rendered sterile, it would still have environmental particulate on it (e.g. skin cells).

Ginsburg,Jacob Lissoos,2020-06-17,"On Call: Werner Kaufmann (external innovation), Steve Hanley (product development and testing for plastic performance materials), Jinghang Wu (technical manager polyurathane systems), Sam Hutchinson (tech development), Eric Ginsburg, Stuart Rowan   Explained that some of the portfolio originated at Case Western University and background working with Allotera, initial funding and the material how to isolate CNCs with that  Explained working with Argonne on how to scale up to larger scale  Explained working with Allotera pulp making facility in Ohio and they are working on building going from pulp to CNCs   Interested to see if the process is cost effective, once got the response, the team was interested (preliminary cost effective analysis that was sent)  Clear that no confidentiality agreement in place   How does the cost compare to alternatives?  Stuart explains more of a technical advisor for allotera but he recommends talking to them and that he would put in touch but mentioned cost at about $15 per pound which is less than current charge for standard commercially available CNCs higher yielding and MXGs grow 6ft per year so it is an easier biosource to utilize which is responsible for cost savings   What is the difference between wood and MXGs?  The MXGs are slightly longer in crystal size which allows use of lower amounts lower loadings and better mechanical reinforcements   Allotera is building a facility to go large scale, one step is pulp making facility and other is large scale production  The scale up research has been done, just need to build the facility itself   Big challenge is homogenious distribution of the nanoparticle within the polymer and is possible   What is the decomposition temp? Depends on how you isolate the crystals and the acid conditions during the isolation. When you get the MXG cane treat with acid that dissolves cellulose and leaves crystalline cellulose   What type of solvent is being used? For some applications this is critical.  Depends on the polymer, ideally suspend nice in water, if polymer suspends in water can do anything in water. Dictated in water. For polyurathanes have done in emulsions, standard is in DMF usually or NMP things that are not scalable which is why working on better ways to do this. One of the biggest challenges for scaling up is how you process and use solvent. Can do this in latex, alot of work in oil and water latex and works well.   Negative charges on the nanoparticles which helps dispersion in water and polymer, prevents aggregation of the nanocrystals, so isolation method that gives the negative charge is important   Can the material be fully transparent? Yellow tint. What are the key criteria for this material to be added and what are the key features that would be improved?  Modulus of a single nanocrystal is 80GpA and data for MXGs goes up to 100GpA  Casting a neat film somewhere in the range of 10GpA  Optically transparent films, no yellowing or anything unless heat above 150 for sustained amount of time   Can think of them as uber cross-linkers   Polyurathanes make the most sense low loading and significant changes to material properties   CNCs ca hydrogen bond together very significant reenforcing network strong filler filler interactions   Charges on the CNCs allow them to be separated and isolated, partially sulfonated otherwise cannot sperate the material when isolating   Would the eclectic field help with dispersion? No, but can help with alignment   Hyderogen bond competing solvents allows for preperation without things precipitating out   Mice studies with injections are fine, inhalation may be a concern   How reactive are the hydroxy groups on the CNCs due to steric effects, can it react at RT or need elevated temp?  90 deg without a catalytst but lower temps with a cataylst, it depands on the OH and what position from the sugar but done different chemistry on the primary OHs all kinds of different chemistry   Send experimental samples of poyalls and help in dispersion and explore the application in polyurathane system or in GPU as a starting point and guidance from Werner on how to initiate collaboration and process and driving force through performance materials   Looking for big change in properties if they are going to be willing to engage   Action item next steps are to look at material transfer and collaboration agreement",Neutral,Positive,0.07876648753881454,0.027601420879364014,0.8936321139335632

Do not want spend all the money into salary, keep virtual and farm to CRO and be efficient about it. Take preclinical programs to clinical proof of concept as quickly and cheaply as possible without bricks and mortar and salary. PI can be involved as much as want to be.   Each company is at a different stage in its evolution. The goal is to get the company to be R&D ready. They all share resources.   Brittany mentions arrow and how it fits with the other collagen binding technology and that he is open to conversations and learning about that in addition to the antibody binding technology.   Shobha wants to prioritize what for her is worthy of the deepest look at University of Chicago and get more information. When through all of the techs to discuss further.   Most interesting is the SCA6 program, where is the data today and what else has been done in terms of progress.  Focus of the lab, still working on it. Has not been a publication since 2016. IP is an issued patent in the US and that one is closed methods of treatment IRES inhibitor. Newer family of the IP that describes inhibitors in broader terms. Heather will send the issued patent and the pending patent information as well. The question asked is: variability in terms of the symptoms and whether he has addressed that. Help him develop the assay to guide and monitor therapy.  Is the PI someone who is easy to work with? Yes What is the form of the deck or further data? No deck, would have to be put together. He put together a description of the current state of his lab that is 1.5 years old.  Is he interested in creating a company? Wants the work to get into people corp partnership, sees himself as helping to make sure his baby is in good hands.  Anything beyond SCA? Various forms but that is the main focus.  Heather asks small disease population-what is it about this disease that catches interest? R&D partners are interested in gene therapy as a whole and also anything that is neuro degen  not concerned about lack of deck: send IP and lab write up   Jeff Hubbell Collagen binding platform:  Quick update on that and where things are, broad application and which is furthest along and most advanced with regard to data clarity on multiple POC: RA, MS, Inflammation  Data in the RA model in particular and expanding into the other spaces  Knowledgable about company process but wants to stay in the lab  Very easy going  Does have slide decks for all of the platform, ArrowImmune and collagen binding  Asked if Arrow has raised money yet? No but working on it  Targeted immunotherapy for cancer  They do like to be the first money in if non-dillutive and they like to lead the round. Can take the entire round without syndicate or syndicate. The goal is to book end the techs  Get them on the phone to talk about both technologies, patent applications pending for platform techs PCT filed and for Arrow have about 5 patent families at broad nationalization and a lot of coverage there, open to speaking on how to collaborate and invest in new co or arrow  Who is running Arrow? Jeff Hubbell and he is looking to pull in a CEO and has not happened yet.  Connect with Jeff as the follow up  Julian Solway asthma and IPF small molecules, the data is not that compelling and wants to hear thoughts.  Data does not do justice to the new data that is generated since then. 2 patent applications on that. Comp of matter over 100 compounds, actively testing these out.  One covers fibrosis and asthma and the other in Glaucoma and cancer metastasis  data that is in the one pager not justice, newer compounds may have more compelling data  not the most optimized that they have  Has not published yet  Active area of work for Julian   Next steps: call with all 3 of the inventors and Shobha provides days and R&D partner wants to be on the call too  Open to CDA with Jeff Hubbell",Neutral,Positive,0.03186644986271858,0.012752063572406769,0.9553815126419067

Thelma Tennant,Jacob Lissoos,2020-06-23,"Phone call to discuss Lesniak CAR T and virus  On the call: Cameron, Thelma, Han, Lesniak  Repeat Cameron introductions for Han and Thelma while waiting for Lesniak   Bank early stage technology companies and start companies himself-licensing and company creating with management, PI as chair of SAB and identify others for SAB, sometimes post doc as well, 50-50 formation vs banking  Been around oncology and autoimmune and finances like a bank not a VC  Cameron states the goal is to learn what the portfolio looks like, how to chance indications, what is different, where he wants it to go What he wants to see happen and if the model is a reality for it  Cameron has looked at a few oncolytic deals before, has a handle, he is a virologist, so focus on some details for the technology and proof of mechanism that de-risk the approach to date   Lesniak makes intro: chair of neurosurgery, issues with replication, distribution laterally with the tumor mass, antiviral immunity and clearing that but people are more looking at taking advantage of this to boost immunity  Main issues of poor viral distribution through the tumor mass and issues of efficacy.  Karen develops neural stem cell line for clinical applications, approved by the FDA, stem cell line can be systemically injected or direct to brain and cross and goes to other side, kind of like a vehicle, tends to go to areas of injury, stroke, cancer  Combine the virus and load this onto the stem cell line to allow the potential to overcome viral spread and replication barriers to limit pre-existing immunity to lentiviral vectors  AAV that has modification to bind receptors expressed on tumors, created virus, loaded onto neuronal stem cells, 10+ years preclinical  FDA 4 years ago IND for first in human clinical trial using delivery of neural stem cells  Receptor mediated update PK7 modification that binds to heprin sulfate proteo-glycans on tumor surface, highly expressed in tumors (transfection)  Transcriptional modification is the survivan   Where is the mfg being done and how much is available right now?  Mfg was done under a grant collaborative and cross institution all academic and produced enough for phase i clinical trial completed  Phase II is planed but need to produce and manufacture 90 days  In the stages of planning the phase II study  Phase I trial completed novel delivery of virus and was also the first time that could do upfront, not recurrent and then get standard of care radiation with chemo and there is a radio-induced promoter so may replicate better  Finished phase I 3 moths ago with no tox observed at highest dose   Has Roger on his team that can deploy large trial at 300 sites around the world  Need to decide if want repeat dosing or not   Cameron asks about the phase I learning: had 3 doses and the highest cohort never showed toxicity, the limitation is the volume of injection to the brain and the number of cells that can be produced  The protocol was single administration not repeat  Did subsequent radiation induce the promoter? Or outside the scope?  Would have to go back and do biopsies, limited with IRB guidelines can't do for everyone, but went to do resection and did have a few examples with clean histology and just necrotic tissue, patients that responded, manuscript is being prepared right now, some emerging data about the biology even though just phase I data   Versatility and addressable market of the technology?  Neurotropic because of the neural stem cells, the other caveat is that the FDA allowed upfront usage but extended from glioblastoma from most aggressive to also less aggressive tumors-->rare indication expansion  No one has completed a phase I study with stem cell delivery yet and also have a way to track and image   Need to raise some money to run a phase II clinical trial and Cameron mentions that this is at the lower end of what he does, the amount of money needed to be raised for the trial is within range of what he does  There is not a legal entity housing the IP separate, Karen had an entity that had an option but the company dissolved and that has expired   Cameron mentions an IIA with one leading the charge?  Thelma mentions for the IP this is true, and University of Chicago would be the one who is negotiated  The additional work is owned by Northwestern and improvements would be handled by NU and they also have the clinical package for the phase I and IND filings   Cameron contemplates straight forward to set up Delware C4 and then work on exclusive worldwide license and talk about milestones and terms  Cameron's model seems to work with the UChicago model for licensing and that this should be standard and an SRA to fund the clinical trials and Cameron gets the Bayh Doel restrictions   Emphasize being fair to the founders to avoid sperate investors and inventors in different classes  Mindful of dilution   Only potential issue that is slight nervous is how do you mitigate a serious event in phase II and wants to talk about a pipeline of new techs in preclinical around the platform to make investors feel a little better (new tech or new application) so that  the tech does not collapse with one adverse event in phase II to make his investors less cautious is worried about a serious adverse event in phase II if the company is public   Can even be a preclinical asset to assure people that this is not the end of the road   Lesniak mentions other applications: intranasal delivery for pediatric brain tumors (no treatment) the underlying technology is very robust and certainly other applications to mitigate the risk  What Cameron wants to do is raise different rounds for the preclinical work and the clinical trial   Cameron wants to go under NDA to see everything that they have and NU would have to be under the scope of this to talk about the clinical trial results  Cameron needs to get comfortable with the phase I for due dilligence to understand the protocol and the grounds for well tolerated  People not looking for efficacy but wants to look annecdotal for ways to get a handle on this",Neutral,Positive,0.03232240676879883,0.0270790234208107,0.9405985474586487

Start out with facilitation of specific questions:  What work has been completed beyond what they saw with the Staph infection models? What is the development status? Published work.  Model of infection and colonization (different mouse models) want to use fresh human blood because mouse does not show all activities the infection can exploit to stay alive such as coagulation, have not really developed any new models, focusing at the moment on trying to see the antibody effector function and the mechanism of this effector function.   With regards to the function, how are the MOA studies progressing?  It is not clear how the bacteria gets killed, hard to find correlates of protection.   Have antibodies against coagulase, looking to find synergies and have bi-functional antibodies   Any work to improve affinity for the antigen?  Not yet, prefer to use human and not humanized antibodies in industry. So that means would have to repeat and go back to isolation of the antibodies since would have to go synthetic to further improve affinity.   No data to show compliment, difficult to show because of the challenging surface of the bacteria   No killing in Serum, is all due to the effector function   Also working on modification of protein that does not bind in order to produce immunity   Based on antibody results does that mean that developing a vaccine will be difficult? Developing a vaccine against the same bacteria, will that be difficult because of some of the findings shown by the antibody?  Also working on the vaccine, vaccine also targets protein A and mentioned some of the vaccine efforts occurring to date  Advantage of using their antibody is the fact that it targets protein A specifically   Neil asks about the compliment killing and wants to ask how that is actually working?  Dom says that she does not know yet and is trying to develop assays for this.  She suspects there is compliment killing but they are not positive about it.  The distinction she is making is that to kill Staph you need an immune cell, if simply have compliments it won't kill. If you have an antibody that binds a gram - bacteria you would get killing.   Dom will be able to provide clarification in the next few weeks, Brittany will facilitate with providing the information as it becomes available.   For Virtici to try to understand where they are at, if the paper is accepted that would help them to look at strategies to optimize the antibody and move this along.   Beyond publication, any other data under a CDA? Dom says yes, but she wants to know what they will do with the antibody.  Dom wants to share publication when it is out with Brittany and then resume the discussion under CDA if there is interest.  Heidi asks if there is any information they can provide to help with the process. After publication, would want a summary of what is available under CDA.

I wish you all the best for your new opportunity, it was a pleasure working with you.  With regards to Chuan He’s technology, we focused our discussion on the method to detect RNA modifications.  I had one discussion with Heather on this technology where I addressed some question but I never got a response. These questions/discussion points would have been important for the path forward in developing an assay.   • In the existing for the RNA-sac kit would be an expensive kit as it would require three different enzymes (MjDim, Bst2.0 and FTO). Chuan He mentioned an improved version that would reduce this number. • In addition he mentioned that he is working on a new version that contains a different but well known  RT enzyme. An enzyme that had been used for other purposes and would overcome the need of the control reaction. That would be important due to the costs and of course lower the amount of input material.  • The last aspect was the use of Iodine: I am not sure that we would be allowed to ship this reagent with a potential kit. And apart from epigeneticists with strong chemical background, I am not sure if this reagent is available in many more biological related labs. It would be nice to receive your feedback in this direction.  Following he discussion we had internal discussions on HiC alternatives and discussed the CAPC-Seq approach. At the moment, we do not believe that this method is something that we would like to commercialize. One reason is that we believe, that this method still would fall under the original HiC  IP, which had been licensed co-exclusive to three companies. Not questioning the novelty, but it still covers some of the main claims of the “original” IP.  The main interest still would be the Kat-seq approach, but during the original meeting he mentioned the interest to develop the method further and commercialize through his own company. I do not know if these plans changed or if there is any other opportunity to cooperate on this method.

Brittany Butler,Jacob Lissoos,2020-07-28,"Hi Jacob, Hi Brittany,  I hope you are well, I am getting back to you regarding the sephin1 project,  Unfortunately, after our review, we made the decision to not pursue our discussion about this project.  Scientifically the project is well writing with interesting data, however we identified three points appearing like “no-go flag” for us in our scouting process: • First, we compared the preclinical data on EAE models available in the patent with our respective preclinical data about a similar project for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and we obtained better preventive and symptomatic effects regarding the delay of the onset of symptoms and the management of relapses.  • Secondly, the effective dose (8mg/kg) seems to be the current approved dose of Guanabenz in the treatment of hypertension without a dose effect potential, bringing two problematics for the commercialization: o How to avoid co-prescription? Here, the use of reduced dose seems less effective, and a potential combination with interferon will be required to prove a synergistic effect. o How to manage potential adverse effects related to the use of an antihypertensive drug?   Nevertheless, we keep a strong interest in the University and the Grossman Institute projects, and I hope we could keep in touch in the future about others potential opportunities of collaboration.  It was nice to e-meet you Jacob and it was a pleasure to discuss again with you Britanny,   Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have other opportunity matching with our seeking,  Take care of you, and good luck for your new job Jacob!

Hence, his data commons framework he developed in AWS will be re-written in Azure by the Rush University. He spoke to Rush, and they have agreed to work on this. Hence, he will be working directly with the Rush to help them on the architecture side of it.       Rush and Microsoft on partnership will be developing the data commons in Azure, which will be open-source.  So Dr. Grossman, directly not working with Microsoft in this project, but working via Rush.   We want to connect directly with Dr. Grossman and work with our Microsoft healthcare research team, if possible.

I've also been pushing along some internal discussions in the last week, and there are a couple areas we would like to continue exploring in particular.    Preeti mentioned a startup accelerator focused on quantum software and hardware; we would like to have a dedicated discussion to learn more about the effort. We would be happy to discuss ways in which we could contribute our time and our experience to help guide participants and grow the quantum ecosystem. This is something our executive team has much experience doing and greatly enjoys.    As I mentioned, our researchers have also identified a number of faculty who we would love to get to know.

Our team has spent some time digging into the super-resolution imaging technology and has reached the point where a conversation with the inventor would be really helpful. As we look to define and understand potential markets, there are some technical questions we have for Greg Engel and/or some of his team. We see this as a potentially interesting technology to commercialize and the team’s insight and ideas will help us narrow our focus as we evaluate potential markets and competitors.  I realize this is a busy time of year, and we will have a couple of our Science Committee members join the conversation as well. Would it be possible to schedule a meeting on Wednesday, September 30th, 5:30pm central time?

We received many high-quality submissions with exciting scientific potential from numerous Institutes and therefore had to make hard choices regarding the selection of proposals to move to the next stage.     As we noted in our previous e-mail to Omkar, your proposal is definitely innovative and we would be excited to work with you. Budget constraints made this project, which is very early, hard to prioritize among some more 'target-ready' proposals. That being said, we do encourage continued engagement.                  It is a bit tough to discern if this project will lead to novel targets or therapeutic pathways for intervention. Are you planning to pursue this line of research with existing funds? If so, and you are able to generate data from what's proposed in Aim 1, we would be very excited to collaborate on functional studies.                One key question is: How do you think about bridging or translating the findings from rodent studies to the human setting? We expect interorgan signaling pathways will be different across species. Is there a way to prioritize conserved pathways?                 As work in your lab develops, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d encourage conversations every 6-12 mos as data rolls in.

David Gross,David Gross,2020-10-23,"David, Omkar,    I hope you are well!   Please forgive my slow response in returning feedback to you. Our goal on the asset acquisition team is to act as the internal champion for these research proposals, and that means trying to garner approval from many different individuals on senior management. So sometimes it can take time to get everyone in the same room (or Zoom meeting) together.    We were all super impressed with the science being advanced at U Chicago. Right at this time we could not come up with tractable development plans that play to our internal strengths at BridgeBio. Since we wouldn’t be the right partner to translate these scientific approaches to patients, we aren’t in a good position to provide funding. For now we are going to stay on the sidelines and hopefully stay in touch with the investigators. We are happy to help in other ways – by providing more granular feedback about ways to position their research for translation, or perhaps trying to introduce them to others who can help.    There are more details in the feedback document, but for your info, I summarized the logic behind our decisions below. The science is stellar with each and every one of these, and I am just highlighting the business/strategic reason below for you.   Dr. Dawson – He is advancing an unconventional treatment modality (quantum dots with cell-permeable peptides) that we don’t have R&D experience in Dr. Moskowitz – His research is too early for translational support because he is still looking for new ways to treat congenital heart disease (as soon as he might find a way then we are excited to re-engage) Dr. Roos – He is targeting a protein that is not mutated or genetically altered, which is out of scope for us given we generally only support therapeutic development that aims to directly target the underlying genetics in disease Dr. Awad – There are too many mTOR inhibitors already in development for us to believe we might have a competitive advantage (or IP space to work with) in developing another one    I hope the investigators find the feedback helpful – our goal is to provide more than just a yes/no answer, but to really be transparent about why we are not the best partners, and what data or experiments might change how we view the approach with regard to our pipeline and strategic interests. I remain encouraged that if we are able to repeat this process next year we may be in a better position to help.   Let me know if you or the investigators wish to speak over the phone.

Eric J. Ginsburg,Michael Hinton,2020-11-09,"Eric,   Good morning. I hope your week is off to a great start.    Our team has finished our review of the 2D monolayer technology. While the scientific advancement is an impressive one, we feel that the technology is too early stage for our platform. Additionally, several of the market opportunities our research identified as having strong commercialization potential are outside of Professor Park’s main research focus. We are interesting in keeping in contact around this technology, especially as new work is done on electrical, optical, and optoelectronic properties of nanostructures, although we believe that there is additional early stage research and validation that would be needed prior to the technology being ready for our platform. I’ve attached our final summary report.    Please let me know if you have any questions. Also, we’d be happy to connect with Professor Park if he is interested in a conversation around potential market applications.    As a quick update on the super-resolution imaging technology and our review process, we are still talking with people in various industries regarding a range potential applications. We have not identified a market that would be large enough to support commercialization of the technology yet, although there are several more industry experts we are connecting with, and we are hoping to find a market that could support the technology.    I hope you have a great Monday.    Thanks,   Laine",Neutral,Positive,0.22595182061195374,0.012795602902770042,0.7612526416778564

In summary, we were of course really impressed by the relevance and the depth of expertise and extremely thankful for your coordination and the time spent by the faculty with us.   Below is our current thinking and the next steps we plan:   So far we have done the following sessions: 1.Prof Chen – Nanomaterials to sense different materials in liquid, e.g. water… As my team, we need to assess “Water” opportunity and if we think it is a market we can go after, we would like to circle back to Prof Chen. If Prof Chen thinks that there other applications of his technology in gas sensing or other application spaces, he can certainly let us know and we would be happy to reconnect. So the ball is in our court (few months of effort on our side) unless we hear otherwise. 2.Prof Tay – Covid-19 based on Saliva, Sepsis, Microbiome… We thought that there could be of an immediate interest here. We are working on a project which may pivot and become really relevant to Prof Tay's research area… We may come back to you in weeks to see if and what we can do. 3.Prof Maurer – Quantum Sensing with potential Gas Sensing apps.. We thought that this was big game-changer. But we could not tell if it is ready for application in the next year or so if we were able to id an application. I personally would be happy to follow up with Prof Maurer to assess that angle. If it is really the case we can do something in the near future with 10x benefits to the next best alternative, we can certainly explore further.   Hope the comments above make sense.  Should you have any questions, pls let us know. I am happy to chat as well, if better.   If we do not connect, happy Thanksgiving to you and your loved ones.

I shared the list of PIs and project information with our Applied Science team, and we think there are certainly opportunities to collaborate with each of them.

Please let me know your thoughts on this, and if you have other suggestions on how to engage with the PIs.   Thank you very much.

David Gross,Jennifer.Mihalek@chicagobooth.edu,2021-03-11,"Dear Dr. Crowley,   I hope this finds you well. I am writing to gauge your interest in exploring a research collaboration between Roche and the Chemical Biology group here at the University of Chicago.    The Chemical Biology research group at UChicago stands out for its focus on translational science.  To date, these researchers have formed 5 startups and have 62 patents.  The research group has expertise in discovery biology, in addition to traditional chemical biology.  There is an opportunity to partner in early stage discovery in different therapeutic areas to identify new molecules against novel targets that may be too early or high risk for Roche.  Given Roche's research interests, we believe we can structure a mutually-beneficial partnership.        Would you or someone at Roche be interested in an introductory call with our Corporate Partnerships team (cc'd) and select researchers to learn more about this emerging area?   Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.

As discussed please find attached a leaflet with some information on our platform and collaboration goals.    As I mentioned, we're currently looking for collaborations around our hepatocyte-targeted siRNA platform. This  platform can be quickly repurposed to target any new gene for any indication/TA, as long as gene is hepatically expressed, so the idea really would be to collaborate with research groups with novel therapeutic genes/MoAs that could be addressed with our platform.  TAs where we might be more likely to identify hepatocyte genes with a role in disease are Hepatology (NASH, fatty liver, cholestasis, bile acid disorders etc) but also cardiovascular disease/lipid disorders. But literally open to any novel indication as long as an attractive hepatocyte-focused MoA has been identified.  Although currently not within my immediate remit,  I'm happy pass any non-confidential information regarding delivery technologies (to other tissues) to our chemistry guys as well.

Could you please provide a Honeywell attendee list for each topic?  I can run point on scheduling on our side.  Looking forward to furthering these discussions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.   Project 1: Wireless Underground Sensor Network (WUSN) based IoT for agriculture and environmental Summary: Over the past few years we have been developing scalable, working buried wireless sensor networks using fully buried, ruggedized sensor boxes, along with a low power wireless IoT system such as Lora and Sigfox.  The system includes data collected every 30 mins and curated and visualizable in near real time at Thoreau.uchicago.edu.  The sensor box technology includes the sensors (soil moisture, pH, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil), microprocessor, radio and antenna, power supply and moisture sealing.  Currently we have a 23 node WUSN operating for ~ 1 year at a working farm in the Chicagoland area.  We also have research undergoing on building sensing devices for dissolved nitrates—there currently are no good in-situ nitrate sensors available today as products.     Project 2: Computer Vision with Applications to Livestock Monitoring Summary: Computer Vision (CV) is a particularly important technology for digital agriculture. Several AIFARMS projects are driving research in techniques and applications for CV, such as 24x7 monitoring of livestock health and behavior, video-driven high-throughput phenotyping for plant biology and crop sciences, video-based disease and pest detection in crops, and video-guided manipulation of objects for automated harvesting.  AIFARMS aims to make progress in both novel uses of AI technologies (such as CV) and in foundational AI challenges that can make these far much more effective.  Key AI research challenges in CV that we are tackling include occlusion, individual animal identification and tracking (which can be much harder in some livestock species than in humans), pose estimation, behavior prediction, and 3D reconstruction.   Project 3: IoT and Edge Computing Summary: Because of the pervasive and diverse uses of sensors in agriculture, IoT and edge computing are essential technologies.  Our vision for a farm of the future is a highly networked and sensor-rich operation enabled by an extensive, low-cost IoT system that monitors and manages most or all production activities.  Key technologies we are exploring include mobile and fixed camera networks, environmental and biochemical sensors, distributed heterogeneous computing, federated learning, and edge computing  (including edge machine learning).

However, I believe that there is still room for optimization of the compounds, something that Celdara has limited expertise with. We have been working with several other technologies for fibrotic diseases over the years and have an interest to discuss a collaboration once a single lead compound is selected and is ready for preclinical development.

I mentioned that I was having trouble finding a responsive contact at P&G to reach out to for this purpose. My name is Felix Lu and I serve as the Director of Corporate Engagement for the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) at UChicago. My job is to evangelize the relatively youthful PME, and facilitate connections between companies and the resources of the university.   I'd like to get your thoughts on exploring a research collaboration in the AI-ML space with the relevant faculty here at the PME. Just for context, we have previously spoken with Pete Ellingson and Marko Stojanovic about licensable IP ( if I recall correctly) from UChicago. We got the sense that P&G was mostly looking for relatively high TRL and technologies that were almost consumer ready. Being that P&G is a large company, we also wondered if, like most other large companies, there was siloing and thought it could be useful to talk to others – thus our outreach to you about this lower level scientific collaboration! &#128522;   The AI/ML for Materials research group at UChicago stands out for its focus on translational science. To date, these researchers have 56 patents among many other accolades. As you probably know quite well, computational materials design, informatics, and simulations using AI and ML are going to be indispensable tools for developing new materials and sustainable solutions to capture market share. There is an opportunity to partner in early-stage research to utilize the expertise at the PME, other parts of UChicago and Argonne National Laboratory to develop, characterize, and screen novel materials using AI and ML.   Given P&G's general interests and presuming a wide spectrum of development, we believe we can structure a mutually beneficial partnership.   Would you and/or your research oriented colleagues be interested in an introductory call with our Corporate Partnerships team (cc'd) and select subject matter experts here at the PME to learn more about this emerging area?   Please let me know if you have any questions.   Best,",Neutral,Positive,0.02994379587471485,0.013147678226232529,0.9569085836410522

Omkar Bhave,Felix Lu,2021-11-04,"Hi Istvan –    Slightly tangential topic –    I was wondering if SABIC had any interest in participating in an IUCRC on the topic of AI enabled water-energy nexus?   If so, this proposal led by PME professor Junhong Chen in collaboration with Argonne National Labs, Northwestern University, and Washington University in St. Louis, would like to cordially invite SABIC to be a founding member of our Center.   We are currently working to put together a full IUCRC proposal to be submitted to NSF on Dec. 8, 2021. As such, we need letters of commitment to accompany the proposal submission. So far we have received a letter of commitment from Xylem, Phillips66, AECOM, Black & Veatch, and MWRD, with a few more to come.    I am attaching a letter template for you to review and edit. The paragraph “Should AIWEN IUCRC be selected by NSF for funding, SABIC commits to joining AIWEN as a Full Member at the membership level of $70,000 on an annual basis, pending availability of funds, and accepting the NSF's required Membership Agreement.” is required by NSF.    I am also attaching a draft membership agreement for your review – this is the standard NSF template agreement and all members need to sign the same membership agreement.

I’d like to get your thoughts on exploring a research collaboration in the AI/ML for Sustainable Materials space with the relevant faculty here at UChicago. We engaged with Grant Weatherford and Neil Simpson at Milliken but have been having some trouble getting responses.   The AI/ML for Materials research group at UChicago stands out for its focus on translational science. To date, these researchers have 56 patents among many other accolades. As you probably know quite well, computational materials design, informatics, and simulations using AI and ML are going to be indispensable tools for developing new materials and sustainable solutions to capture market share. There is an opportunity to partner in early-stage research to utilize the expertise at the PME, other parts of UChicago and Argonne National Laboratory to develop, characterize, and screen novel materials using AI and ML.

Few of our key concerns  include:   (i)                  70% isoform similarity between Talin1 & Talin2 (with no data to demonstrate selectivity of the given siRNA for Talin2); (ii)                involvement of Talin2 in the functioning of cardiomyocytes; (iii)               lack of impact of siRNA on key profibrotic cytokines like IL 4, IL 13 and TGFβ; (iv)              modest reduction of cytokines, especially, IL6, IL10 and TNF-alpha in Talin2 knock out experiments; (v)                small molecule inhibitor of Talin2 would have a greater effect than the siRNA against Talin2, as such an inhibitor would also inhibit existing Talin2 protein, instead of just lowering the number of mRNA talin2 sequences. The small molecule would be able to disrupt existing focal adhesions more effectively than would the siRNA. We were more keen on siRNA as a modality than conventional small molecule.

It was great to have Omkar provide your input on how to move forward, with the thought of wasting as little UC faculty time as possible =)  Here's an update from my conversation with Eric Pamer....  Eric Pamer talk at Seres After speaking with Eric Pamer, he said he'd be happy to give a presentation to Seres' followed by a smaller, round table conversation with what the DFI is doing to advance microbiome therpauetics in more depth Re: Faculty Natalie indicated interested in I asked Eric if he had any thoughts on the researchers Seres listed would be good to touch base with. Here's the short of it: · Jennifer Pisano - antibiotic advocate (using the right antibiotic only when needed).  · Chris Lehman - great researchers, but still a fellow · Christina Ciaccio - intimately involved with ClostraBio. [My thoughts: since ClostraBio is run by Cathryn Nagler, it would be good to keep Christina at arm's length, as I have heard it can be difficult to collaborate with Cathryn] It should be totally fine to ask any of them to attend the meeting when Seres tells us what they're interested in, but may or may not be overlapping in their current projects.  Additional faculty Eric Pamer indicated might overlap with Seres interests Eric indicated that it would be good to have additional DFI faculty in the meeting when Seres presents their needs, including: Sam Light, Arjun Raman, and Laurie Comstock.

David Gross,Felix Lu,2022-07-25,"Wayne – I be interested in hearing your thoughts on this.   A contact of mine from 2019 (Jun Amano – his son studied at UChicago and graduated in 2020) reached out to me with his Konica-Minolta (KM) colleague (Kevin Ninomiya) inquiring about having a virtual Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) program here on campus. David Gross from the Polsky Center (cc'd) joined me on the call.   Basically KM is interested in hiring students who are entrepreneurially minded (presumably this program allows them to filter those who are interested enough to start up a company) using KM IP and some resource help from KM. From this, KM wants to create joint ventures. This is still exploratory and they have not worked out all the details of such a partnership but seem to be flexible at this point. They are also open to having some kind of curricular-type engagement which would integrate their IP and ideas for projects that lead to new ventures.  David asked if a pure talent pipeline would be of interest to them and I believe they said yes. (Briana cc'd)   Topics they are interested include materials and materials design, along with nanofabrication processes, etc. (I can send a list from their slides) – but they seem to be reasonably well aligned with PME and DSI interests. The time frame they are hoping for is starting their next fiscal year (April 2023).   Has Berkeley had anything like this to your knowledge? Any insights?

Omkar Bhave,ann.schlesinger@novartis.com,2022-10-10,"Hello Omkar,   I hope you had a great summer.   I'm following up on multiple PIs/ opportunities that you shared with NIBR earlier this year in the Immuno-engineering deck, as well as the deck shared after the BIO meeting.    First of all, thank you for putting together all the information, especially for flagging the rising stars at U of Chicago. Unfortunately, most of the opportunities/ PIs did not match NIBR needs, and the NIBR teams did not see a path forward so declined to engage at this point, including the teams working on immuno-engineering related projects to whom I proposed the exploratory discussion that we had envisioned.    The opportunities from the following PIs are still under consideration, and I expect to get back to you with an assessment soon:   PIJeff HubbellMelody SwartzSamantha RiesenfeldAaron Esser-KahnJustin KlineHans SchreiberRobert GrossmanLoren Walensky  I think that it would be good for us to touch base in November; we are putting together key NIBR needs for targeted outreach that might enable us to find ways to bring our research teams together. I'll follow up with some time options.   Kind regards,",Neutral,Positive,0.05591679364442825,0.02443072572350502,0.9196524620056152
